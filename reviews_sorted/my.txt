Rated Taste is Good ,the ambient is too noisy FOOD - 2 SERVICE - 4 TASTE - 2 AMBIENT - 1 VALUE FOR MONEY - 2 REVISIT URGE - 1 only concern is taste.|negative
Rated Visited this place after some gap in last month. No valet parking,no credit cards, always there is a crowd so you need to wait, food is OK but pricey, desserts are good. I am finding it to be hyped restaurant with so many negatives against few positives. In today's digital world if an restaurant doesnt take credit card then it's not happening. You cant expect coming to a overpriced restaurant with too much cash in pockets, come on we are in the world of digital wallets. Coming to food, when ovenfresh started it used to serve sandwiches, burgers and pastries. The place was small, with time they expanded in to bigger place. They also used to serve egg sandwiches which were to die for, with time they stopped serving them. There was a time when people used to flock for desserts to ovenfresh but nowadays there are many options for desserts also. I would say with long wait, parking issue and no credit card it's an not a worth place except for few dishes which are overpriced.|negative
Rated One of the best biryani's I have ever had in my life. Being a local resident this is one of the regular eating joint for me. They used to serve tandoori chicken, crumb fried chicken, kheema pattice, burger. I dont think this still exist on the menu and I miss that. Been fan of this since 90's and looking forward for all those finger licking delicacies back on the menu.|negative
Rated It was my worst visit to this restaurant. The food and its quality and service all r not just worth..Biryanis are selectively better but its total waste of money...?|negative
Rated All of us know the concept of Sigree(assuming). For those of you who don't know, Sigree is a restaurant where you get barbecue(veg & non-veg) on your table. They have an arrangement where in the middle of the table is where they will put the barbecue and then continue to bring the barbecue on skewers till the time you want. In simple words, unlimited. This particular outing at Sigree was because we were a group of 14 and thought of coming here as there is no need to worry about what to order, what not to order kind of stuff. This was a tuesday and we thought that the place might not be crowded. They started with the welcome basket and the welcome drink(unlimited) and then started the problem. Among the 14, 4 were veg and the rest were non-veg. The staff would just not bring veg unless you remind him 3-4 times. Ok, if that was not enough, for the non-veg stuff, we asked, reminded and followed up with the staff for almost 25 minutes to get the fried prawns and seekh kebab. Not sure what was the problem but he would always say, Yes, I am getting it next but everything else was being brought in abundance, just what we requested was not being brought. I have been to the Malad outlet twice, once on 14th Feb for valentines and one on a weekend(guessing it was a weekend), but never had such service issues. I am hoping this to be a one time issue and if I ever go back here(which is very unlikely in the near future) and if the service has improved, I will definitely increase the ratings.|negative
Rated The most underwhelming food experience I've had in a long long time. Had the bbq chicken bao. Serving size, availability, taste, presentation and service everything about this place was disappointing. Never going back unless they seriously change their game.|negative
Rated Went on a Sunday evening to wade away Monday blues, cursing our decision though. Food is below average, is there even a way to make substandard momos! We called for Singaporean salad, it said stir fried vegetables with grilled tofu n crushed peanuts. The tofu wasn't grilled n it tasted like paneer, there were no crushed peanuts so asked them and they just bluntly took the bowl n filled with so much crushed peanuts. The people who work there have no enthusiasm whatsoever. Friend called for a chicken curry with rice, which was average as well. Located inside the Todi mill complex this place was such a disappointment. To make ourselves feel better we had to go to zoe for desserts.|negative
Rated Finally visited the iconic cafe. Ordered fish and chips, cold coffee and butter chicken with naan. The food is excellent! Butter chicken was one of the best I've had so far. Overpriced food is the only complaint.|negative
Rated This place is the bomb. After having a hectic day, just going there and being welcomed is just beautiful. The pizzas here are out of the world especially the Bombay Masala. It is my favourite dish in this while place. It is full of Indian spices and has a tadka if you may say which just has bomb of flavours in it. We also had the vegetarian pizza which was full of vegetables and was quite overwhelming. I have been to this place a couple of times and have always been impressed. This is a must go to place.|negative
Rated It's been a long wait for some good food to be served at Jamjar Diner. With 10 of us fighting over which restaurant to go, one suggested Jamjar and that's the last time we are trusting her with choosing a place to eat. Ambience: A tad hard to find during the night. Once entered, the interiors were well done with all the cool elements. But the seating was very uncomfortable. Service: We were first given a table on floor above and later shifted on ground. No perfect reason given. The servers downstairs, on the ground floor, were forgetful and reckless. Took more than half hour for shakes to come. Pizza ordered first came the last approx forty five minutes later (seems they were practising FiLo). Food: Orders were brownie shakes, mint chocolate chip, coffee hazelnut and caramel shake, olive feta crostini, nachos and onion rings for small plates and White penne margarita pizza for mains. Brownie shake stood out. Crostini was bad and nachos followed the suite. How could anyone go wrong with nachos? Pasta in Alfredo was good treat, while the mozzarella in pizza was burnt which gave it a smell which didn't appease others. Overall: Everyone's experience is different and from my dining, it's plausible to say it's highly overrated.|negative
Rated The Philly Cheese Chicken Sandwhich - Multigrain sub filled with grilled chicken strips, roasted bell peppers, onion rings in a BBQ Mustard sauce and melted #heese . And yea an Oreo Shake completes it! Yum!|negative
Rated I have ordered food from this restaurant through zomato and it turned out to be total disaster....I ordered Bombay burger and veg chilies....the later was too bad and the former so cold that it became worse....no sauces were served no chutneys not even a sachet of tomato ketchup.... The experience just couldn't be worse...|negative
Rated Ordered food for delivery via Zomato and extremely disappointed in the customer service. Once my order was placed I was called and after a little difficulty with a language barrier it seems that part of my order i.e. the nan bread was unavailable. No problem I asked for an alternative and that seemed to cause a little confusion with an inability to give me a choice or a price. Online it had shown a 45 minute delivery period but that suddenly jumped to 2 hours once my order was placed. I asked for confirmation of that fact as if it was really 2 hours then I wanted to cancel my order. Again either a language barrier or just that they wouldn't cancel so I said go ahead and deliver asap and they assured me it would be within 45 minutes. 1 hour 15 minutes later my order arrived. The delivery guy gave me the food and the bill (I had not idea what the new cost was going to be as they couldn't confirm over the phone) After a 100 rupee delivery charge the bill was less still just less than 800 so great value although not so much when you only have 1000 rupees and the delivery guy just laughs when you ask for change. I guess I was the idiot who gave him the 1000 as he laughed in my face (would have preferred a thank you) but at this point it didn't matter how tasty the food was I would never order from here again. There are too many great options to waste my time being treated so poorly. nofixedabodeforsue.com|negative
Rated The restaurant doesn't live up to the hype. Went for the buffet and all I got was disappointment, yes, the ambience is completely different but that's where everything stops for this place.|negative
Rated Hard Rock celebrates it's 10th anniversary in Mumbai. Insane levels of pumped up energy is what made it so awesome! The entire restaurant was up tapping their feet to rock, retro & edm hits! Moving on to the food, we started with Mac & Cheese Poppers served with a cheesy Alfredo dip, the poppers were yummy & fried to perfection. Nachos were tasty, typical American style loaded nachos served with guacamole on the side. Santa Fe spring rolls are a must have! Main course consisted of Twisted Mac & Penne Arabiata. Twisted Mac was gooey & delicious. The Arabiata lacked a certain oomph. And of course, a night at Hard Rock is incomplete without the entire staff standing on top & dancing on the evergreen YMCA!!! It's been 10 years since this awesome place opened up in Worli. Good food, great ambience & brilliant service! Hats off to the entire staff of Hard Rock Cafe for making dining at a restaurant so much more than just food.|negative
Rated Disclaimer: This review is solely on the basis of food. Slightly delayed review, but on New Year's day when my office was one of the few silly places to ask it's employees to come to work, I decided to cheer myself up with a lunch by myself at Hard Rock Cafe. Bad idea! I am a fan of soups and though not on their menu, I checked with them if they had any soup. Surprisingly they did have the Chilli soup. What came was a bit of a surprise. The soup tasted like strained tomato with a lot of garlic bits thrown in for company. The accompanying bread too came with a field of garlic on it. I don't have a problem with garlic but some taste apart from it would be nice. The bummer though was the veg fajita. The problem might be that for me the benchmark for fajita in Mumbai remains Chili's. The fajita at this place claimed to have guacamole, which though was conspicuously missing in the final dish. The tortilla was a little dry and vegetables uninspiring. Final word: the place is know for live music, atmosphere and it's drinks. Go for that and expect very little from the food.|negative
Rated I am personally quite a huge fan of their pizzas. But they don't serve cold coffee and some or their drinks are quite bad. They use pipes to line the ceiling, making for some interesting decor.|negative
Rated Joey's pizza! Joey's pizza! it was in my hanging around my wishlist from a very long time. After the reviews i read on Zomato i thought this place will be worth the try. So i decided to visit this place on a Sunday. This place is located in the same lane of China Pavilion which is bang opp Versova police station. I visited this place at 20:00 after a drive from south Mumbai. I reach here see the place is fully packed with lots of people waiting for parcels and a table. One hour of estimated waiting time was provided but it took one and a half hour pathetic really😑. Hunger levels at the top of the world were now not bearable anymore but this is not the end more 1/2 hr for the order to b processed. At 22:10 i got the first bread into my stomach i have never waited such long in my life. We had ordered Veg delete,Sezchuaun chicken,spicykeema. Joey's special and tornado. With garlic bread and garlic bread with chicken kheema. I really don't remember which pizza i eat when as the order was coming after we had to drag the waiter towards us. We got one garlic bread after everything got over. But i did liked all the pizzas. The service out here is awful the staff is very rude and unsupportive. I asked him about the pizzas which is what he couldn't reply he called his senior, his senior comes tells me about one pizza and runs off😑. They also did a mess by giving us wrong pizzas lucky we didn't had them. But unfortunately there was a couple behind they were also treated with the same mess there, but they had started with the pizza. They sensed the mess and reported having the wrong pizza. It doesn't end here the senior asks them to pay for the pizza instead they had ordered Medium size he asks him to pay for atleast Small size. This is the worst ever service i had witnessed the arguments kept on getting heated the senior isn't ready to accept his mistake from his end. But the pizzas were good and thumbs up to their pizzas but service is a nightmare. You need more staff to go on with the flow.|negative
Rated Ok so after reading a ton of good reviews for Joey's I am hesitating to write my review! First of all I was annoyed by this noisy place which had stiff and uncomfortable chairs! I was the only vegetarian in the group and thus when my mates were lickin their fingers off pepperoni I was slogging to finish my pizza with bitter olives and my mood was indeed embittered by this experience! Non vegetarian food might be good... but a Big Noo for Vegetarians 😮|negative
Rated I would have given this place 4/5 rating but because of these reasons I am giving only 2.5. 1. We ordered one normal base pizza and one with cheese base, but they gave both with normal bases. 2. They were not accepting their mistake that they took the wrong order and starting blaming us for that. 3. They charged us for the wrong pizza. (Only for the Cheese Base) which we didn't even get from them. 4. They changed our pizza and gave another one after 45 minutes. So we were charged more than the the two pizzas we had that too after the argument of about 15 minutes. Pizza was decent specially the with the cheese base. But the overall experience was ruined by them.|negative
Rated Very poor service and waiting for an hour to receive the order. I am not going to visit this hotel from now onwards and I have experienced this bad service thrice the service to each member is very bad|negative
Rated Worst home delivery service ever faced in my life.....this Restaurant is only 10mins distance from my house.... I ordered food at 8.45 and they got my parcel at 10.45...after 2 hrs...bullshit service...please any one dont order from this restaurant ever.|negative
Rated Food is strictly ordinary. Ordered the pasta and it was lumpy and the pasta threads were all ripped. I have had home delivered pasta and inspite of delivery 30 mins later, it has come in non lumpy. Also ordered bacon wrapped prawns. The bacon was slightly undercooked.|negative
Rated Update 2.0: these guys were really kind and sent me a free order meal along with a huge cake. Thanks guys! Really appreciate you making up for last night's horror. Update: it finally arrived after 1 Hr 56 mins. Surprisingly lukewarm and not cold. Though after keeping me hungry for so long I'll say the portion won't do any justice I Placed my order at 7:40 today. I'm Still waiting for my delivery (it's 9:20 now)...needless to say I'm not going to enjoy cold food. The guy on the phone is not of much help either, he's been saying it'll take just 10 minutes since the beginning.|negative
Rated It is by sheer chance that I stumbled upon this place. Decide to have a burger and went for the most "hatke" one ... "Just Too Much, Bacon and Beef" burger. And it wad just yummylicious ... Ekdum super buger. Will take the risk and say "Burger ho, toh Sorriso".|negative
Rated Is this a joke? The shittiest burger I have had in a long time. How is this even a burger joint? And stale sweetcorn from a can is the salad?? Ya this must be a joke..|negative
Rated I really liked this place! Although I must confess that it was a bit costly! The Romana pizzas actually felt really authentic and the drizzled olive oil was indeed an Icing on the crispy pizzas! The dough balls seemed quite quirky for me as a first timer! I would surely come here again(When I want to be exorbitant)|negative
Rated review after long. Hmm . ok this time we went to pizza express near to our place (marol ). It is the second time there but they always disappoint us with their pastas. The second time also pasta turned out to be the a complete spoiler. we were so disappointed after ordering pollo pesto baked. hardly any chicken, simply bland, no taste at all. thankfully the pizzas we ordered were better and an evening was saved. the melanzane piccante (pizza) was good, again a mood killer the pizza comes with rocket leafs as mentioned in the menu but they gave us withlettuce leafs, who puts lettuce on pizza??????????????? Never coming back. disastrous food for 2500..... sad|negative
Rated decent pizza, very slow, poor, uninformed service! Plus many draught taps with no beer in them... So overall a strictly delivery restaurant option|negative
Rated Bad rating for the service. They have given us very little space to sit for the size of our group, though I had given them a heads up very well in advance of the arrival of people. Waiter had served us wrong beer, denied his mistake and refused to change it. Non-veg food was good, veg was average.|negative
Rated If you are a vegetarian tis place is a big no no The restaurant has an aroma of fish every where... Place is good but the sitting arrangements sucks We went out for a family dinner though the place was too crowded the service was too the mark And most importantly food it's an average place for a foodie not great options ... Though the fish lovers wld eat n hog .. It's a strict no no for vegetarians and even chicken lovers Whatever we order we had to change it as the captain would say it's not available in kitchen or it would take time Overall bad experience|negative
Rated Sinfully delicious. Imaginatively baked. Fancifully presented. Hopelessly irresistible. Can one ask for more ? U try once and u're hooked ! Try at your own peril ! Undoubtedly 5 Star !|negative
Rated Only if I could rate it any lower... This place is pathetic. We ordered food at 7 pm and post calling 3 times it never came till 8.30. Pathetic place. Just plain pathetic.|negative
Rated Wondering why I happened to visit this place after three years of staying in Powai. It's THE place to head to for those days when you're low on cash, but really need that meat binge. They serve killer kheema parathas which are unbelievably cheap! Absolute must have! There's zero ambiance value, but the food makes up for it. Total value for money kinda place!|negative
Rated why is it mandatory to rate...why is this place so popular...why was it so crowded... is there something wrong with people's taste or they lack options... chicken biryani, anda paratha, zinga masala..these were the items I wasted my money on...I should have rather eaten my money and satisfied my hunger than putting it on this outlet...my flatmate will now have to bear all the sarcasm for don't know how long for suggesting this one to me...|negative
Rated Worst food ever I had in my life. Cause loose motion after having form there... not only for me but for my friends too. Had suffered continues loose motion for 12hours...... it was horrible.... their kitchen if u are planing to get wasted.... you can go there. Not a gud place to have food.|negative
Rated Horrendous food... if there was an option to give a rating below 1 that would be deserving for Sunny Da Dhaba. I saw a few ratings at 3.5 for this place and thought of trying it out for the New Year's Eve... I had ordered for Chicken tikka, chicken reshmi, mashroom tikka, fish tikka, paneer tikka, veg biryani and chicken biryani. Each and every item was horrible. The food was just a hyper overload of mouth burning chilly. The kababs were super dry and the meat was tough. The biryani was an insult to the concept of biryani. Would never go back and if you are reading this should not waste your money even trying this place.|negative
Rated Restaurant is OK.. Not that great and food is also OK.. But it is one of the overpriced restaurant it started with a bang but slowly it is started to fade|negative
Rated Went for lunch .. kitchen was about to close. Waiter was forcing us to eat thali rather ordering something from menu. Food was cold as it was already prepared .. chicken Masala, fish curry an even bhakri and rice was cold. Not good experience .. fish curry is expensive.|negative
Rated Bad food... Rice had worms .. When complained was told that it is coriander .. Chicken served wAs stale in smashed form no whole peices.. Extremely bad experience|negative
Rated A small joint on the way to Kanjurmarg station. I got a feeling of walking up to one of those old Jumboking outlets which were spread out across Mumbai. This place is somewhere between the old Jumboking and the conventional McD store. Looking at it solely as a run of the mill burger joint, this place almost does justify the 4 star rating on Zomato It offers burgers in the price range of 20-100 rs. which makes it a place to grab a quick bite in case you are in a hurry. I had the Spicy Paneer Cheesy which was soft and adequately cheesy. It would be unfair to rate this place in comparison with a McD or a Burgerking. If you are expecting burgers of that level, you could be disappointed.|negative
Rated Definitely not a place that would appeal for a dine in. The area is a bit crowded and it would lead to difficulties while trying to find a place to park. Had a chicken biryani takeaway which was mediocre. Value for money food.|negative
Rated Pathetic. Completely stale food. Peas in rice pulao seems artificial/fake. Chicken and rice were stale. Very spicy food despite explicitly requesting non spicy and he acknowledged.|negative
Rated very very bad food quality. cost is very high compare to taste and quality of food serve, we had chicken noodle soup which is only like hot salted water with boil chicken pieces. real strange when we seen it got shocked!!!|negative
Rated I ordered a non veg club sandwich. They gave three slices of bread with only mayo in it and chicken in one layer. The grilled sandwich also has the same thing except for one lesser layer of bread. Grilled sandwich is 90 and this is 180. They charged 90 extra for one slice of bread. I called and the guy said. There was no patty inside? I said no. He said he will replace. Its been 1.5 hours and still no one has come to replace. And I'm still hungry. Horrible horrible horrible service.|negative
Rated Disappointed. Refried lollipops. Sent egg noodles when ordered for chicken. Tasteless roasted chicken. Chilly chicken ordered was main course but sent dry. Totally messed up order.|negative
Rated Pathetic delivery. Problem with Zomato or with bellpepper not sure.. Ordered at 8:45 and promised order at 9:40. No delivery, no intimation till 10:00. Only when I called them, they said it will be another 45 minutes before delivery would happen. Would not have ordered if I knew it was going to be 2 hours for delivery. very bad experience|negative
Rated Worst Experience....I called up the restaurant to place a home delivery order...i have placed an order multiple times so I just asked the guy who was taking an order that if I booked through ZOMATO then would it be cheaper ??He said that the prices would be higher if I booked through Zomato...so I took his word for it...but then just out of curiosity I wanted to check the rates through Zomato...it was 30 rupees less..the amount wan not much but I called up the restaurant to clarify why I was told that it would cost me more if I placed the order through Zomato...they were completely trying to deny what they had told me earlier and started calling me 'yaar' on the call... i will never ever order again and i will make an official complaint.....|negative
Rated I thought the other bad reviews were exaggerated and so ordered. Terrible mistake. By far worst food I've ever eaten. And delivered late. I ordered the "recommended" combination rice and honey chicken. Pathetic. Bland rice bland noodles in the rice. Literally nust boiled and thrown in there. There were 3 pieces of chicken, more like bites in the entire thing. Inadequate gravy, but that was a good thing because it was so bad. I literally cried after taking a bite. Also ordered the spinach and cheese spring rolls, oily double fried pieces of garbage, too salty and stale cheese. I would call them to complain, but I want nothing more to do with them. Going to try and forget it as a bad dream and hope i don't get diarrhoea like the other reviewers. Just stick to standard delivery places in the area. No need to experiment or you'll end up regretting like me.|negative
Rated Worst food ever! Taste is nothing great, plus it got everyone at home a stomach upset for two days! The worst thing is I had only a bite and I was throwing up for the next 24 hours due to stomach upset and nausea and regurgitations. Worst Chinese food I've ever ordered. Be warned, make an informed decision.|negative
Rated I scream, you scream, we all scream for ICE-CREAM.. Ha-ha.. I'm so die hard fan of Natural's ice- cream shop.. The ice served by them are just so awesome. My all and every time favorite is sitapal and tender coconut and Alphonso mango something.. They have got a huge variety of flavors of ice-cream..|negative
Rated It's a streetfood joint but he's got one of the tastiest egg delicacies ever,and what's surprising is the majority of crowd that eats there is Jain people but what i hate is his delicacies are pretty costly too!|negative
Rated Coming since ages,road side shop with no ambiance and proper sitting.But who cares when taste is king.Be prepared for ques on weekends and they serve in cars too. Coming to food its abt ande ka funda...uhave the staple omlette,bhurji,half fries and workd but u have all crazy preps. like pizza,paplet,ghotalas and what not ..go for anything and you would not be dissapointed. Try their boiled fry and paplet ..lip smacking The masalas are potent and taste addictive. Only drawback is he uses margarine instead of oil or butter so health freaks beware and the pricing is on higher side .|negative
Rated What comes to your mind when you hear chicken roll, chocolate bomb, blueberry cache, exotic strawberry, lemon crackle etc. Yes it is merwans cake shop. I think high quality and low price is their moto. Just loved it.|negative
Rated Tea Pea is one of those places where you can hang out with your friends over a bunch of snacks and enjoy some board games. Basically, a place to spend some quality time with friends or yourself (there is a book shelf too). We ordered their Garlic Bread Sandwich, Cheesy Nachos, different tea mocktails like Pepper mint tea, Gulkand tea and cold coffee. Cheesy nachos were not up to the mark but we really liked their Sandwich and cold coffee. The place is light on the pockets and can be visited frequently.|negative
Rated Mad Over Donuts very aptly named, I am really MAD OVER DONUTS from M. O. D. Apart from one time; I don't remember seeing MOD and not visiting it �?�? I have tried all their donuts and Choco Bomb remains my favourite. fooodgalli.wordpress.com|negative
Rated The Tuesday MOD is one of the best things as a college going person ! Choco Bomb, Double Trouble - Chocolate dark Knight- if you like dark chocolate Rasperry and strawberry donuts were just okay actually not even okay. Never mind. Their other donuts make it up for it ! Ambience -3.5/5 Service-4.5/5 Value for Money-4/5|negative
Rated This place is does not want their customers to stick to them.. I order for two from here every weekend.. However today as I wanted just one portion of kebab.. They were too busy to send it to their regular customer.. I didn't mind waiting.. But they just refused!! Pathetic approach to business.. Will think twice before ordering again !|negative
Rated I've been waiting to try this place out and finally found the perfect opportunity for it. The place is small without any seating arrangement so the options are only take away or delivery. I ordered Rajasthani kebabs and Banjara kebabs. I had to wait about 10-15 minutes for the order to be made and when one has to stand next to a noisy parking lot on a busy road, it gets a bit annoying. The kebabs had gotten a little cold when I reached home but that did nothing to deprive us of their deliciousness. They were succulent and moist and wonderful. Served with a side of a mild mint and yogurt chutney and salad, it was a nice snack for three of us. They also have biryani, rolls, matka kulfi and dudhi halwa, all of which I will try soon.|negative
Rated When in Borivali west ; if you are a South Indian Cuisine make it a point to visit here !! The Idli and Dhosa Platter are their Specialities in S.Indian Palate. Dont miss the Kulfi Falooda here.|negative
Rated I was looking forward to visit this place as had read many reviews about it. I was passing nearby with a friend of mine so decided to try it out. We ordered Kulfi Rabdi Falooda and a KitKat shake. It was not upto the mark the way I expected it to be. I liked the Kulfi Rabdi Falooda, something different but gelled up really well. KitKat shake was really disappointing, it ended up tasting just like chocolate milk and huge chunks of KitKat in it which was really irritating, nothing innovative. Service is okay, Overpriced I feel, Ambience is just okay.|negative
Rated Ridiculous place when a guy At reception desk is almost threatening to hit you ... After a argument when I had reserved a place , he asked me to get into waiting if I go for Sheesha . . No info was shared . Nobody knows u have separate place for Sheesha. Should have called police . The guy name is mahesh .. I don't know what can be done with such people . Management has to get better Deserves a - 1 Don't go to this place if you don't want to insulted . Everything sucks|negative
Rated Being a rooftop place in the locality of Colaba, without a doubt the ambiance has to be very pleasing. Many Westerners & Shaikhs visit this place. Food is good, but the service is so damn slow. Seemed to me like the Waiters didn't give a damn about the Diners.|negative
Rated I don't understand y people even like this place? Don't you kno your meat or food well? I've been to KKR twice they're roti only taste good in the entire roll. The meat filling is stale n smells weird. Typical roadside food. Complete disappointment!|negative
Rated I was very much excited for the rolls they serve. I'm very big fan of rolls, specially rumali rolls,frank rolls, wraps etc. I knew kathi rolls are supposed to be authentic bengali rolls with gravy and all. We ordered for a paneer tikha roll and aloo burnt garlic mayo and was extremely disappointing. Lets break down into every item. ROTI was pathetic, both veg and non-veg rolls rotis were cooked on the same pan. The BURNT GARLIC MAYO was very disappointing, it had a weird pungent taste which spoiled the entire taste of the roll. THIKA PANEER was horrible thika (spicy)|negative
Rated Yet another overhyped Mumbai joint in line with Bade Miya and the likes. Tried their so called exotic green chilli ice cream and failed to find anything exotic or different about it. I need to try more dishes to give a final verdict on the place but their flagship ice cream disappoints clearly..|negative
Rated Take 2 hrs to process a single order and when we checked again they had lost our order. The staff constantly kept lying saying the order has left. The food was completely unsatisfactory|negative
Rated Poor delivery experience. What i hated about it was they lied saying the order is on its way where in fact they didnt hav any idea that such order has been placed.. Took 1.5hrs to get one order..(i live half a km away from this place) Food is ok.|negative
Rated Been trying some Wok places lately , unfortunately Wok Express did not have that wow factor i was looking for . Not that bad too but strictly ok. Flat Wheat noodles - Broccoli , Baby corn , Chinese cabbage , Zucchini ++ Chilly Basil + Hot crispy Garlic + fresh cilantro and crushed peanuts . Tasted ok , could have been better. Crystal Dumplings - ok Skipped the Sushi Chilly mushroom Bao - NO Try it out and review it .. prithvishashar.wordpress.com|negative
Rated Theobroma, my favourite bakery in the city!! The chip butty, their signature dish and the garlic mayo that's so different which will not fail to impress. This one is definitely on my craving list. Available in chicken, bacon and egg. The cakes are divine. Our birthdays are incomplete without their chocolate truffle. The banoffee pie is also a must try for banana dessert lovers. The dense loaf and banana bread is a small thing to take away. And their cookies. I cannot stop raving about Theobroma. It's one of those places I take everyone to.|negative
Rated Terrible service at the colaba outlet. A small group of us had come here to pick up some cupcakes (4 to be exact). It took us no less than half an hour with the extremely rude and inattentive manager and cashier. We've told our whole office to avoid this place. We were big fans of the food, but can do without being snapped at by a disgruntled worker. Avoid!!|negative
Rated Crappiest crepes ! Filthy water jugs... Not the most friendly manager you come across .... Total disappointment ..... I am not wanting to c the bill board of this place .... Basically just a showcase of desserts with utterly tasteless stuff ...|negative
Rated The burgers and the wraps are a treat. Don't order fries for home delivery. They can't be consumed. The chilly cheese fries are amazing for on the spot and the oreo shake. The red velvet shake was a complete disaster.|negative
Rated Skip the siders.. Go for the burgers.. God father burger.. Big daddy burger! All mind blowing.. Do also try the batter fried oreos.. Total value for money.. And crazy stuff.. Will be back for more!|negative
Rated Not impressed with the crowd... Lousy Service... Evry1 calling out for Aslam and Aslam hardly cared... They have a sheesha zone as well.. which is tagged as the Smoke Zone... but you can even smoke in the restaurant area. Saw a group of Teenagers abusing each other even in presence of children and females around... Burgers were freshly prepared and quickly done... The Big Daddy and The Godfather..... they are champions.. you cannot finish either of them alone... the taste was very good... they mean business when it comes to taste... this rating of 4.5 is only for the Taste... Taste - 10/10 Ambience - 6/10 Service - 5/10 Value for Money - 8/10|negative
Rated Disclaimer- after having a burger at Howra you will not settle for bugers anywhere else. We ordered 2 Big Daddy bugers, one Shai Shai burger with chicken, one Honey Singh burger and Chicken popcorn. The burgers are bomb. Fat chicken patty, veggies, melted cheese slice and dripping sauces with two fat buns- foodgasm is the only word. The entire combination of all the elements together is mind blowingly good. And ofcourse, deep fried oreaos in bater and topped with condensed milk, and you can't move for a bit. Nice place, outdoor seating, cudve done with better ambience but the food just makes up for it.|negative
Rated A little food joint in busy bustling market near bombarded deying mills. Seems it is like family driven cafe, however servers were little unresponsive. Although a little expensive also if compared to the quality offered. Tried thupka and herb rice. Thupka was ok and herb rice was horrible. Rest what I can suggest can be visited in case there is no option available. Damage 600 rs for thupka and rice along with chicken ginger|negative
Rated We ordered pizza and pasta from cpk for a take out. Pizza was cold by the time it was delivered. We had ordered a penne in pesto with shrimp. We got chicken instead. The pasta was tasteless and bland. Pesto was surprisingly white instead of green. Nothing was up to the mark.|negative
Rated Monster burgers that are so good that you can't stop moaning! The burgers are accompanied with fries, mayo and a sanitary wipe - how great is that! Must try out: 1) Jamaican Jerk Chicken Burger 2) Original Frisbee Chicken Burger 3) Cheesy Veg Burger 4) Gulkhand Shake Amazing meal!|negative
Rated Since this place is near to my college we always end up comin coming here to eat. I recently had the cheesy fries and the alfredo pasta with ice tea. The cheesy fries tasted a bit tad but thr pasta and ice tea are great|negative
Rated Arghhhhhh...This place is such a waste of time & money, a totally dead place with absolutely dull ambience, staff is lethargic & not at all co-operative. I had been here with my sister to spend some quality time but it turned out to be such a disastrous plan, all thanks to their very pathetic coffee�? We had ordered a Ferrero rocher shake which was actually close to being tasteless. The hazelnut blast cold coffee was still a bit better than the ferrero rocher shake, the bronze frost coffee was the worst amongst all & for these three small sized drinks the bill was around 650 bucks which seemed like a complete waste, would never ever visit this place again. Please please please avoid.|negative
Rated Been here loads of times but atlast i remembered to write out an review. Special for its cheesy stuff.. Do try thier new Malwani Cheese Melted Garlic Bread and alos their Masala Milk.|negative
Rated My experience here was disappointing. Place is very small and I found it unhygienic, you can't just have their regular water! Food is not at all cheap. We ordered Cheese chilly toast (recommended by zomato), costed 190 bucks! Moreover, it was not that tasty. Mulund has better places to go!|negative
Rated Heard about thambbi frm many ppl so though of visiting bt it was a bad idea..ordered pizza dosa it was okay okay n rava masala dosa that was also okay okay n d sambar sucked to d core it was lyk plain simple colour water😈sambar is ma favourite bt over here it was disaster 👎😭|negative
Rated Food taste is okay. Quantity is very very less. We had ordered nachos with beans and salsa sauce, trust me one of the most boring nachos i've ever had. The salsa sauce was moreover like a tomato pickle or sabji. They served me kiwi margarita with a STRAW and yes some pieces of apple in it. I think the bartender needs to understand the diff between margarita and sangria. There was no taste of kiwi in it tho. Highly disappointed. Still i took a risk to order a dessert and made a mistake again. Tiramitsu had a excessive amount of gelatine in it and so it tasted really bad.|negative
Rated I really crib and cringe not to go this particular outlet of domino's, whenever my friends set afloat domino's idea. I'd rather go to RMall or Mulund East to binge on the amazing domino's pizza. This place has a scary vibe to it, the staircase gives me nightmares. How can they even think of building a business around such horrendous infrastructure. The pizzas and other foodstuffs are fine, but it is sad that the service is Lousy and more importantly that the fillings or the toppings are are scanty most of the time. I pray before getting in and do the same while getting down to be safe and secure with all my bones. PS: Call in for a home delivery, that saves 15 mins of your time in unnecessary adventure climb ,sans protection gear.|negative
Rated Worst subway outlet I have been to. Bad service. The guy won't even cut the bread well. The sauces are shared and they make the customer wait. If crowded and they also have orders, they can't handle the customers. He marked the sandwiches wrong and my friend got my sandwich and I got her. She couldn't eat it as my sandwich was much spicier.|negative
Rated An online order going wrong. Sending a not soo filled bread is totally disappointing. The bread was toasted as requested but the veggies were there only for namesake. Totally dissapointed.|negative
Rated Oh please don't eat here! Dismissive service and pathetic food! I feel sorry for places like these. They invest in infra etc but nothing to show for it! If India's population was lower places like these wouldn't survive.|negative
Rated Great food with a lasting taste. However i am changing my review. This is the third time they are late. Dont order for delivery they take forever and are full of reasons! It is sad to see such great food being marred by bad service. I visited and the same issue late service! Mosquitos. Guys do something about your lbs mulund branch before its too late!|negative
Rated Horrible customer experience of all time! The order taker took the order and conveyed that the food would be delivered within 40 mins. Its been almost an hour and half now and still there is no food. Spoke to the customer order taker who said the driver / rider is lost / new so it will take another 30 mins to reach. OUTRAGEOUS. I called the centre 4 times only to have the phone shut on my face all the times. Previously also I have called and each time I have had the same experience. You would think that they would improve after giving feedback as any other self respecting chain would. I have lost hope in them and I seriously believe that they should just shut shop. Anyone else facing the same problem, give them an eye opener. Please add a negative marking button on the portal.|negative
Rated Horrible place in terms of pricing!! For a place in borivali, it has rates higher than a Marriot!! Juices are for Rs. 234/- Steam rice is for Rs. 234/- Fries are for Rs. 400/- Mineral water is for Rs. 54/- (Rs. 20 is the market value) Imagine the margins they have!! what is the logic behind this kind of pricing. Not that quantity is humungous.. It's same as any other restaurant. Ambience: 4 storey place. My first experience of this place when I opened the door was inhaling a blast of hookah. Sad state!!!|negative
Rated I had such a bad experience with the food here. The ambience etc is brilliant. For a place in borivali, it kinda outdoes every other restaurant in the vicinity. But the food and the service was so disappointing. After a 20 min wait on a Sunday afternoon, we managed to get a table on the first floor of the restaurant. We ordered for the following - Khichiya Masala Papad - Worst I've ever eaten. The khichiya papad had NO onions or tomato, just stale papad smeared with green chutney and even stale sev. I've never had worse khichiya in my life. The corn soup was yum and good in quantity. I'd totally recommend it. The Singapore noodles was Okayish. We didn't get the soy sauce, vinegar sauce until we had to try and get a server's attention for 15 mins. We also had a Hawaian fruit punch which was again weird. The pineapple they used to decorate the glass was smelling. I felt like bringing all this to the notice of the manager or staff, but none of them bothered to look at us. And the worst part about this? Our starters, soup, main course all of them came together. So by the time we reached to our main course, it was cold. The blueberry cheesecake saved the day. I liked the fact that they've used a coconut crumb base. The 2.5 stars are only for the soup and the dessert. I wish they'd rectify their mistake. I'd have loved to bring more friends here, but not if I'm going to get the same experience again.|negative
Rated Poor experience at this Dominoz joint. Served cold pizza and the delivery guy forgot to bring the garlic bread sticks so we had to wait till he brought one. The quality has been degrading as well. If they need to maintain consistency they need to increase the quality of the pizzas else it will be hard for them to sustain further.|negative
Rated Pathetic service , the attitude of the manager on duty was so bad , he looked very irritated and I also saw him cringe and use foul language when he was just asked to get some ice. The food though was good.|negative
Rated Scam place, Takes online orders, Doesn't deliver food. Placed an order, no response, no one picks up, they randomly change orders. Never again.|negative
Rated Too much crowded on weekends Wraps and salad are evergreen on subway Cold tea serve here is toooo good Due to crowded taking order takes some time|negative
Rated First things first we found a plastic thread in the sabzi. Were too scandalized after that. This place is otherwise okayish and we convinced ourselves it was a genuine mistake.|negative
Rated so here i'm posting review after 4th visit. located on link road prime location its attract good crowd therefore they increased timing from 5 to 2 in night to 11 to 2 till night about visit food and experience- every time i visited mostly ate italian because it is their main speciality i found it funny when people visit hotels which are special in cuisines other than chinese and then orders triple rice and manchurian balls and then complain about taste if you are interested in chinese then please find some other restaurants. about food all their pastas are very good and tasty 2nd thing they are good in pizza and all from bread lovers. about services this is area where they need to works a lot and should reduce many errors which occurred during all my visit , first of all they use foreign policy like pay for water they put small bottle of water on table charging 30 rs but no glasses every time you have to ask for glasses then 2nd thing is that they are slow in service like your empty plates remains on table for long time unless until you order more and there is no place for new dishes sometimes they pick up everything after you pays and leaves. in one visit we ordered nachos which was took 30 minute to serves and tasted different also its cheese was tasted weird so we asked and they took it back and said we are preparing fresh after 30 min they said it will take time so we canceled it in the end. another thing is that they many time charge weird price mostly mistake as they state and then says sorry we have lack of staff that's why it happened only 2 guys are their who takes orders, serves, cleans and makes bills if your hotel have demand then you should hire more staff to reduce this errors so whenever you go there dont just pay bill blindly check dishes and their charges, on first visit ordered mojito and they served lime soda and charged for mojito 2nd time 2 pasta and fused fries and they made bill of 2 pasta and fusion pasta which was 80 rs more than fries after pointing they corrected and wrote fused price but again priced 140 instead of 120 after that we literally took menu card and checked everything and calculated amount so if you love pastas and pizza and have long time to spend must visit but keep eyes open while paying bills Ambiance- good 3 Food - tasty 4 service- bad 1.5 overall 2.5|negative
Rated I used to pass by Choi Kim Cuisine in IC Colony very frequently but never got a chance to dine in, finally I did went on to try out their food. I ordered Chicken Haka Tofu Kay Thong Soup, Chicken Vietnamese Spring Roll and Chicken Burnt Garlic Rice. It was disappointing, they did had flavours of their own but it lacked something or the other. It was rather a Bland Chinese meal which I had. Service is really slow, it took ages. Bit overpriced. Ambience is just okay, congested a bit.|negative
Rated Choi kim used to be my usual go to place for Chinese food, but off late they have dropped their standards. My all time favourite was the chicken lollipop, schez rice and the kung pao was to die for. Had ordered from here recently and the taste was not at all the same.|negative
Rated Was here sometime with my family. We were suggested to visit this place from a couple of friends. There was a long waiting here which was our fault as we did not know about it. The food that we ordered was all average there was nothing that was so out of the box or extravagant. The only thing I liked here was the virgin pinacolada which I found really good as compared to most places as I have been. The service is the worst part of this place. We had to ask then for water for the 1st time itself. Cutleries needed to be requested. The waiters lacked training. They even managed to drop a bowl of sauce on my mother. Fortunately, nothing spilled on her. All in all I would not go to this place again. Food 2. 0 Service 1. 5 Ambienc 2. 5|negative
Rated I used to be a big fan of Zaffran, when they had only one outlet. This one is really bad. The service is definitely bad but on top of that the quality of food har really gone down.|negative
Rated This two is only because this place exists.Ambiance matters little for me when the food sucks. Everything from the kebabs to the main course dishes tasted sweet and the irony, of all the things the desserts turned out be the worst. Amount of money that I shelved at this place , i could have eaten my heart out for a whole week at Baghdadi. For any cheaptard like me, go to this place only for a office lunch, maybe not even then. There's no reason why one should suffer through this. My recommendations to have at this place, rien (google it)|negative
Rated A small overrated outlet in Prabhadevi, Crave was a big disappointment.Service is too slow, we waiting for an hour for pizza.Ice tea was brought to the table almost after 20 min and this was the scene when the place was not even full.Food is just average and hyped.Pathetic experience!|negative
Rated One of the okiesh place to visit. Burgers are totally ordinary and costly too i am not talking about money for those who have budget. The Knockout burger minced patty of lamb, onions, lettuce, cheese sauce the taste is so average. One more thing I'll tell you the patty was so bad and forzen too..if you're worried about sensitive stomach be very careful. Warm Regards, Kunal Kowli.|negative
Rated Jimmy Boy had been on my list of to visit places for a very long time. I happened to be in the area recently and decided to make a quick visit. When I reached by 2 in the afternoon the mawa cakes were unavailable..which was really disappointing. I tried the caramel custard, chicken pattice and black forest pastry. The custard was so soft..it melts in your mouth. The chicken pattice had a filing of chunks of chicken in a cheesy white sauce..quite yum. The pastry was the star though...soft..not too sweet..in one word..perfect! Would love to try out the other stuff next time.Cheers!!!|negative
Rated A nice place was on my list for a long time, amazing ambience. Must try Mutton Dhansak, Mutton Biryani, Prawns curry, fish. Don't miss ever the Raspberry drink and Caramel custard it will be criminal to miss it...|negative
Rated This place is greaaat in terms of ambiance and the crowd (which is obvious, since it is pricey). The night we visited, there was a retro night, and hence did not spend too much time here. However, go for partying more than the food!|negative
Rated The only good thing about this place is the caramel custard. I usually find good things to say about all the places I visit. But, this one was a really tough bullet to bite. I was really disappointed to see the amount of oil they use to cook all their dishes. I have even ordered in a couple of times and spent at least 5 minutes trying to decant layers of oil from the food. The chicken tikka biryani tastes okay but features the same problem that almost all reviewers have been harping on (too much oil). In my opinion, this problem should be addressed soon. Disappointed.|negative
Rated Didn't have food here. But deserves a 0 star just because of its arrogant manager, whatever his name is. He simply refused to heed our repeated requests to change our seats to a more comfortable vacant table - he kept saying the next guests would have a problem. Looks like he had his family coming. Even when we were walking out, he just kept a straight face. Never coming back again! Please feed your family/friends only!|negative
Rated Grew up eating dosas here So rating this place will be unjust But eating here is more emotional than for hunger may be the old taste is still in my taste buds and don't want to forget it till you are not allowed to eat it The dosa idli upma jhangiri Chaas mysore dosa Onion utaapa Mixture Cofee All on the menu is worth a try Too bad they don't make murruku any more Will come to this place till I can walk to this place|negative
Rated FIRST IMPRESSION Seems like a typical B grade restaurant, but seemed very popular. The tables are standard and have uncomfortable benches. But we were really hungry and weren't thinking straight. FOOD I ordered the idli vada and was not really impressed. The vada was soft and the idli had a very strange aftertaste. The up a was bland with the occasional chilly and I didn't really finish it. We were there for breakfast, so we tried the tea and it was kind of average. The dosas were also very oily and heavy. The puri bhaji was kind of good. AMBIANCE Very badly maintained place and the overall feeling it gave was not very welcoming. The waiters were rude and had ego issues. Any additional order was taken with a frown and attitude. SERVICE Very slow service. For 80% of the time, no one was even in the area where we sat and it was a task placing an order. For some reason they refuse to use pads to take the order and hence, we being a large group, he had to confirm The order multiple times which was very annoying. I RECOMMEND Not going there.|negative
Rated Poor quality of food, ordered butter chicken n there was hardly any chicken n the gravy was watery n roomali rotis were rubbery n the lamb biryani was horrendous!! Please shape your quality or Else ship out! Expensive for the kind of quality n quantity!!|negative
Rated So out of the many times that we've been here, our recent experience was the worst one. Wanting to experiment with something new, we ordered for the Prawn in Butter Garlic Sauce, Surmai Pulimunchi and Bharla Bombil. Each dish a disaster of its own version, The starters - Prawns was slightly undercooked more like a ceviche placed in butter garlic sauce. Quantity base - Prawn 30%, Butter 10%, Garlic 60%. Woah mate, whatever happened to balancing it out. Main Course was the Pulimunchi with Neer Dosa. This dish was so hot, the dosa was our only saviour! Flavour wise, we'd give this dish another chance, however, after specifically mentioning that the heat needs to be reduced. And finally the last dish was the Bharla Bombil. Nothing close to what we were expecting visually; worse, when we tasted it. The outer crust was delicious and the small prawn filling sure was a surprise, but the prawns shells with it. GOD, SUCH A SIN! With much disappointment here, we wouldn't dare ourselves for the dessert. From really high expectations, this experience hit the ground so hard for us, we may never step back into this place ever again!|negative
Rated The food I had ordered tasted stale. Maybe that's why it's so cheap. They don't have much to choose from. It's mostly chicken or mutton rolls that you get there, and for vegetarians, some regular starters that you usually get in parties.|negative
Rated To Start up with,It aint EXCEPTIONAL as everyone writes it to be.Service was pathetic, took them 15 mins to get Roti every time, Servers were very distracted and seemed to be concentrating on only one huge table apparently.Everyone write some insane reviews out here about this place, but seriously ive had better and way more reasonable.Practically overpriced and you pay extra for bad service and mediocre food|negative
Rated Good food but the worst delivery ever received in the whole life.... A small kid is send for delivery and that poor kid is unable to find address for more than 40 mins... Customer gets fed up waiting food starving badly.... All big grown up men working in the restaurant just sit and lay eggs...|negative
Rated It was disastrous. I ordered the mutton paya masala and they charged 200rs for something that was literally inedible. The paya wasn't cooked enough and it clearly was mutton masala gravy that they used. Plus the 7up pet bottle wouldn't open despite me trying pliers and a knife. Horrible encounter and overpriced place|negative
Rated Never order from here if u wanna eat on time. I place an order at 1.30 pm and was delivered to me at 2.50pm and they had assuered me theyll deliver it in 20 mins. Also they get it after three calls and they mess up the order and when asked they respond sayin sorry someone else took the order .I dont even undestand what that means ...Why is "SOMEONE ELSE" picking up ur order calls. First and last time ever.|negative
Rated Had been der tthis evening its near dahisar bridge the crowded place filled with young crowd had 2 pack of chicken mcgrill it also has a seperate party place and 1st floor sitting area....|negative
Rated Crowd is really bad out here. I had visited during monsoon, as it was really in bad condition. Service is pretty slow. An ok place if u don't want a crowded MC D.|negative
Rated Food is decent . However the customer service of the staff here is pathetic. The waiter taking the order as well the one placing the plates , both of them ignored my request for a mosquito coil that I made to each of them twice . I was sitting in the open air so the mosquitoes was making it very uneasy and they completely ignored my request even after both of them said that they would take care of it in a min. It did not come till the very end . Very bad customer service overall.|negative
Rated Really bad experience on both instances that I visited the place. First instance we went at 10.30pm and the Restaurant was predominantly empty. The waiters were Extremely pushy and impatient and there was a point in time where there were about 4 waiters standing around the table watching us while we ate. The minute a bowl hit the table they didn't check if there was more left but were carrying it away. Had to call them back and tell them that we hadn't finished that particular dish. To add to it their portion sizes are not worth the cost. We told the waiters on numerous occasions to give us our space but to no avail. The manager was sitting just two tables away eating his dinner but didn't bother intervening. The second instance the Hotel was much busier but the first dish I ordered was a tomato soup and when it arrived I took one drink only to realize to my Horror there was a mosquito doing the backstroke in my soup. Called the Manager who took it away, didn't bother replacing it and what do you know time of the bill the soup was charged. I think that was a special soup. ( A One Spoon Mosquito soup) This place should not be called Royale masterchef but Royal master flop. I wish I had my phone that day I'd have a picture here of the Olympic mosquito Swimmer in tomato soup|negative
Rated One of the hidden jewels of the suburbs. This place is best for Kerala and Manglorean food. Try chicken Gussi with neer dosa or egg appam. Not to miss desert - parippu payasam.|negative
Rated Worst communication & order complications. Diya Hua order pura hi nahi karte. Never ever order from this restaurant. Even i faced this type thing two times then also no change in their behaviour|negative
Rated Food quality is poor, also food lack taste. thinking to order based on their food pricing, so please don't order. it would be waste of your money.|negative
Rated A small kitchen with a few tables.....to start with the service it was really very slow.....i ordered for a beef burger which was juicy & yummy! But the chicken burger was very bland and did not justify its name. The cheesy fries with ham were actually some fries placed on over melted cheese that tasted like milk.....the ice lemon tea was just made out of readymade stuff & the the straw was of very cheap quality......the cold coffee made us wait for 15mins then they said they wont b able to serve it as the chef was busy & would take more time.....this was a very ugly reason they gave us...this was a big dissappointment for us! Over all its just a one time visit place.|negative
Rated Posting this review after a long time . Bad Staff and Bad service by the staff ! AVOID|negative
Rated Avoid. Drinks are expensive. Food is bad. Service is slow. They are a complete package of doom. I've added .5 just cuz they apologised for the speed of their service.|negative
Rated In short cakes are stale, snacks are old n not fresh, and there is a high probability of finding dead flies and insects in the food. Have personally experienced all of the above.|negative
Rated Worst restaurant ever I seen....they give a worst chicken tikka ever....check out the photos.....their employees are always busy on phone.....don't attend the customer in well mannered.....|negative
Rated This is one of the oldest restaurants at dahisar west . It's never crowded you can go anytime and get a place no reservations required. The food here is really good. I have never had a bad experience here .|negative
Rated Grease garam masala lot of spices no flavor that is standard recipe for any dish ordered once will never make that mistake again...............|negative
Rated This review is for a home delivery. I was too bored to venture out on a Sunday evening for dinner hence searched Zomato for a good restaurant. For some reason unknown, I felt like having Pasta. This restaurant had some decent ratings and hence placed my order. I gave my address and my order for a Tomato & Cheese Bruschetta and Alfredo Pasta. The order would be delivered in 45-50 minutes, I was told. The clock ticked 60 minutes and my order had not yet arrived, so I called up the restaurant only to be told that it had left quite some time back. The person promised to check and get back to me. 15 minutes past my call, my doorbell rang and a person who was profusely sweating was holding my parcel. I casually asked what took him so long. He told me that he was searching for the address for the past 15 minutes. I asked for the chit on which the address was given to him, it had the name of the building, the lane, nearest landmark and most importantly the contact number. What more do you need, I asked him. His Royal Highness replied with a kingly attitude, “building number nahi tha, issliye dhoond ne mein problem hua�?. Sorry Sir, I said and if there is a next time, I will remember to provide my building number. The Tomato & Cheese Bruschetta had gone cold and the cheese had a rubbery feeling and a sour taste to it. The tomatoes were a mix of sour and sweet taste and the cheese being sour only added to the sourness. No oregano or chili flakes were sent along with it. Alfredo Pasta was the next order. Due to the time taken to find my otherwise complete address, the pasta had dried out and become one whole chunk of Penne Pasta. I discarded the top layer of the pasta which was completely dry. The Pasta had loads of veggies in it; mushrooms, broccoli, bell peppers. It resembled more like a Mix-Veg Pasta than Alfredo pasta and the sauce was nowhere to be seen. I had to deep dive to the bottom of the container and scoop out the sauce from the bottom. I like veggies in my food but these guys had overdone it. The garlic bread supplied along with the pasta had chunks of garlic pieces on it and had signs of melted butter on it but that too had turned rigid. All of the above gave me a set my back by Rs.370 inclusive of taxes. Well, this turned out to be forgetful experience for me and the last one with this restaurant. They need to improve big time on their home delivery module. Actually speaking my residence is an exact 15 minute walk from this restaurant and yet this delay. And yes, the promised call-back from the restaurant after checking the delivery status hasn’t set my phone ringing. Food Quality – 2.5/5 Food Quantity – 3.5/5 Service – 2/5 Price – 2.5/5|negative
Rated Sizzling bar house and chilli house belong to one group. Located right next to chilli house. The ambiance is nothing great and so is the service. Had ordered for mushroom alfredo. Was probably one of the worst dishes I have had in my life. The sauce was totally bland and tasteless and the mushroom did not have any flavor. After having their starter was not really in the mood to order more food as was quite disappointed with the one dish I had ordered. The service is also pretty okay. Overall quite a bad experience.|negative
Rated I am visiting this restaurant since my childhood...was never disappointed with the quality of food its very crowded after 8.30 pm...Don't forget to try their tisrya suke,Mutton masala,Chicken lollipop and The vada here is very crispy...good place to visit with family...!!|negative
Rated Recently got a take away from this place. Being bored of the cliched sea food restaurants around my house, thought this would be a good change. The food quantity was varied. While we got some 5-6 prawns in the fried prawns, the fish fry quantity was pretty good. The clamps came in big quantities too. As far as the quality is concerned, it was a bit of a let down. Tasty, yes but too much oil. The pomfret had quite a bit of salt. So overall, nothing extra ordinary.|negative
Rated Highly over rated place. They did have their days of glory but now with mismanagement, the quality here is atrocious. The seafood stale, the chicken and mutton straight out of the deep freezer and the attitude of the management and the waiters is to be believed. A place which I would never put my foot again. Horrible the only word best describes this place.|negative
Rated The crab was undercooked. Bombill allryte King prawns shrunk. Surmai and crab masala made up for all. Sol kadi OK types Nimbooz yum......... On a hard month end I would visit again....|negative
Rated Been here lots of time for dining with family. My best is Paplet Koliwada and Prawns Koliwada. But sometines you need to check as you may get stale food also. I did get stale crab curry once and also prawns koliwada recently.|negative
Rated The place was dead quiet on a sunday afternoon and in Dadar west location , this place kind of surprised us. For a moment I thought it was closed but then we saw one table occupied by a family. The place was dark and gloomy and several empty tables .Keeping ourselves away from that ambiance we ordered chicken Thai style , schezwan fish for starters and tom Yun goon rice for main course. Every dish we iedere was of mediocre taste nothing exquisite or unique to this place. I would not recommend tom Yun goon rice to folks coz it had mint flavour mostly cause of lemon grass in it. The quantity of food was good. Service again was average . And yeah sizzling bar house and chilli house are same , you get both the menus . Chilli House|negative
Rated Chilli house is a restaurant located in the Star mall near Dadar plaza theatre. This place is a combination of two restaurants together- Chilli house and a part of it is SBH (Sizzlers Bar House). There is a 50% off on Domestic alcohol. They have options of lot of starters in veg and non-veg. They also have set menus if you wish to order individual choices. The set menu consists of a soup, a starter and a main course (rice/noodle) optional. Cost: ₹380 only. We tried the kum pao paneer, crispy chicken in the starters. Chicken burnt garlic fried rice and chicken is oyster sauce gravy. The food is spectacularly good, it was not "indian-ised" with that scary 'orange-red' colour to the kum pao paneer. The quantity of a dish is pretty huge, 2 people can easily share one portion. However, I have rated this place less because of their utterly slow service. The service boys are hassled and looked inattentive. We had to call out 3-4times to them till someone would notice. There is a small party area where the bar is located, they give that on rent for small parties- can accommodate approximately 25-30 people. Over all, not really a bad place if you are little tight on the budget. Good food, very reasonably priced!|negative
Rated Food is horrible ,ordered Red dry chilly chicken which wasn't upto the mark, triple schezwan fried rice which was nothing but some tasteless gravy and hell lot of noodles with no RICE in it !!! Poor service & very slow kinda responsive staff. Only good thing is price & booze rates, but it would be great if they improvise in their food quality.|negative
Rated No value for money! Bad sushi, bad sushi, bad boy... sushi I've ever eaten in my life, I'm not a native to sushi. But I found the fish smelly and the rice hard. The ginger was local.. I lost my appetite to eat. I paid for a party pack and...could move beyond the appetisers. I want my money back|negative
Rated Could have given a rating of 0 but unfortunately can't. This is just to warn other foodies to avoid this outlet even if they give you a free meal. Otherwise burger king is good. But this outlet is pathetic. Service is slow. The patty in the xtra long chicken was hard and had something that looked like dried up blood. Probably the patty was reheated as it was oily too. This is the 2nd time i have had issues at this outlet. Should have clicked a pic. I just lost my cool when the guy replacing the burger casually said to go online and give a feedback. The online feedback is a questionnaire with more than 100 questions and I don't have that kind of patience. They don't have a helpline number either. Really pathetic. Next time its gonna be McDonald's across. At least they are consistent in their quality.|negative
Rated It's quite pricey for a place that's relatively new. The food quality is bad. Ironically, it's not fresh at all! On a side note, I rarely ever see anyone enter the place.|negative
Rated worst food!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! fish fingers werent fresh at oll ... waste of money and time too. and the staff too is quite lazy...|negative
Rated The food is too costly over here. Ordered chicken wrap and the Roti that they used was chewy. The chicken was not at all cooked. Hopeless place.|negative
Rated This place is always crowded as it is located at Dadar. Food quality is average and the service I found is bit slow due to the crowd and demand. You will never find silence in this mc.d. None the less size wise it is huge enough and can strike off people's hunger in cheap cost.|negative
Rated This newly opened branch of Macdonalds, located just at the entrance of the star mall is now popular with the college going youth and passersby who resort to this area for shopping. I had tough time finding myself a place here although it was 230 pm. Macdonalds has been my personal favorite for their burgers, but their shakes too have always attracted me until today! The sole reason for me dropping down their ratings is due to the pathetic chocolate shake they served with whom I was in love with. I was glad when they told me they serve machine made shake and not the Mac cafe one. But the staff ruined it all by making it way sweeter than being palatable. On going back to them with a complaint they did change it for me only to make it much sweeter than what it previously was. This is the inefficiency of the staff at this dadar west outlet. Special thanks to Ms. Shraddha for changing my shake.|negative
Rated A normal McDonald's outlet but the service here is too slow, both take away and dine in. Its really pathetic to wait for 10 to 15 mins for a basic normal order.|negative
Rated Hi This is a very small place situated diagonally opposite to the Siddhivinayak temple. I visited this place few days ago. I obviously didn't visit this place with an expectation of having 'authentic Chinese cuisine' so I wasn't disappointed for that part. This place serves Indian Chinese and manages to get it right without excessive oil. I went for Chicken Manchow Soup, Chicken Chilli Dry, Chicken in Oyster Sauce, Egg Fried Rice and Chicken Hakka Noodles. I am thoroughly satisfied with the quality, quantity and the taste. No complaints whatsoever. The only thing is that they don't take cards and that's quite a disappointment, to say the least. Next time when you are going at this place then do not forget to carry enough cash with you. All in all, a very good place and a complete value for money. I would be visiting this place again very soon. Thanks!|negative
Rated Ordered food from the Dadar outlet. Wasn't disappointed at the speed of delivery despite being in Lower Parel. Do try their Prawns Curry and Surmai. Also if you get the opportunity then do visit the restaurant once.|negative
Rated Food was tasty.... Must try mushroom burger #lemon ice tea: 7 on 10 #french fries: 7 on 10 #mushroom burger: 9 on 10 #veggies burger: 8 on 10 Delivery was quick|negative
Rated Location of this place is very shabby and hard to find so firstly if you are going by car and following map direction..park the car outside the Gali only the moment you see too many bikes parked on left and right don't make the mistake of even Going in thinking there would be space for your car to go.. Its a self experience so avoid it.. Walk sm 100mtrs and keep watching on the left you will find a dimly lit door and steep stairs and a small board saying fat boy's kitchen once you have done the taste of climbing all the stairs there are some 4 to 5 tables full with sanitizer, tissues, ashtrays menu and a staff standing to guide you with the menu.. There is also a carrom room don't know if it is staff only o not as it was closed.. Coming to ambience it is a small place with small Streep steps on which girls must avoid wearing there heels.. And as it is open till late party goers are scene here smoking 🚬 and seating there heart out.. Coming to food I had dynamite burger and kitkat and oreo milkshake both of which were quiet good.. We had to remove dynamite out of dynamite burger as it was too spicy for us.. But it will surely be a night to remember|negative
Rated Visit Joss for food theatricals, lip smacking oriental fare and hospitable staff. The sushi's are to die for. So is the Khao suey. Theatricals of the smokin cosmo and the blooming lotus tiramisu is a must watch. Same goes for their signature dessert - The Big Bang Theory. One can give a miss to the mocktails though.|negative
Rated I’ve heard a lot about Joss – the on-again, off-again, hotly notorious restaurant headed by chef Farrokh Khambata, who appears to be the darling of Bollywood. With an element of cynicism, I head to check it out. I am struck by the energy of the place as I enter – for a Wednesday night, the place is postively booming – teeming with people talking, laughing and eating to a soundtrack of the latest club hits. ...

Rated This place has totally lost its charm..avoid going there if u want to lay back and treat your taste buds..been there many times so not much to explore from the menu..will only visit if i dont get a table in any other nearby restau..#off list #|negative
Rated We visited this hyped place in Juhu as a treat from my sister on her new job. Well, obviously, she had a good amount of expectations from the place in terms of quality of food. Sadly, we were left disappointed. We ordered Smoked Pepper Rasam & Coconut Chilli Lime in soups, Malta Twisted 0range Mojito in mocktails, Chicken Tikka Popcorn & Wok Tossed Chilli Garlic Chicken in appetizers, Peri Peri Roasted Chicken Steak & Chicken Masaledar On Flames, Gooey Chocolate Brownie & Sugarfree Vanilla Rice Kheer in desserts, all of which were just OK! We had specifically asked the server if the "with flames" meant alcohol & they denied although that's what we ended up with! The ambience was noisy --- a lot of chitter chatter! All in all, they really need to work on their menu!|negative
Rated Funky but cramped tiny place which you very easily might miss! Photos uploaded of the place are misleading and it turned out that the place is either in a need for touch up or the photos uploaded are long back! Outdoor seating is recommended. Though the italian food is 1 good factor abt dis place!|negative
Rated I ate at the restaurant last week and have been suffering with food poisoning ever since !!! The chicken in the sizzler we ordered was un-cooked and maybe was stale ?!? I spoke to 2-3 other people and they mentioned about few similar cases too.... the standard at the restaurant has definitely deteriorated- The management needs to look into this ASAP before more people fall sick.|negative
Rated Bad experience had to wait for so long after reminding the waiter thrice he got my food ! We ordered hummus pita bread paya soup and fish tikka out which hummus was horrible fish tikka was so salty my god couldn even eat waste of money I'm surely not coming back ...|negative
Rated Its a small place but the variety of food it offers is huge. Place is simple but its known for its tasty food and plethora of teas. Service is painfully slow, everytime. If you are looking for a quick snack/meal and leave, this is not the place to be.|negative
Rated Sunday evening completely ruined. Yes so I am the last person to give a negative review to any place as I understand the hard work which goes behind running a place. But when the staff or management is rude and has no sense of responsibility towards its customers , we have to stand up and write what's wrong. So we ordered food from this place last evening (Sunday 18/04) for a group of friends. Considering this place looked good and the menu had so many option we decided to call for a mix set of things. Burger, 2 pizzas, hummus , some dimsums, rice. So let me start with The pizza, messy as hell and had paper stuck to it. I have attached my food images with this review , the entire pizza was stuck to the box and damaged due to paper. My friends refused to eat it, still we tried one small piece and both the pizza tasted horrible. Burger: bad taste, no extra fillings Hummus: the dish is called hummus and the hummus was given in a tiny small box which was hardly for 1 person also. Rice: average (better than everything else) Dimsum: lacked taste and were raw So we called the restaurant 3 times after the delivery but they did not receive our calls, I have attached a screenshot for reference. The delivery message for food was received at 11.30 when our food was given to us at 9.40. Their delivery app din work. The food was paid by our hard earned money which clearly was wasted. Not to add we were left hungry on a Sunday holiday night. What is most disappointing is the restaurant did not pick up the call or were sorry for the same. Customer service ? Highly disappointed. Yes the food taste can be different for all taste buds but I am sure no one expects this kind of delivery.|negative
Rated “Asian food tries to engage the mind, not just the palate. To provoke the intellect.�? ~ Nicole Mones. Go Panda is a small quick service restaurant serving gourmet Pan-Asian food. As George Carlin says, “Prepare to shell out an extra 80% of your money when you hear fancy words such as gourmet�? but Go Panda is nowhere near being an expensive food outlet. The meaning behind the name Go Panda is that ‘GO’ represents QSR and ‘PANDA’ being an animal of Asian origin symbolizes the cuisine served by them. ...

Rated The food is super greasy, doesn't taste authentic at all. The woks, the dimsums, the Baos, suchha huge disappointment. It lacks the flavours! Avoid this place!|negative
Rated I was late for dinner, wanted a big Bite. Too tired to go out anywhere and to top it am on an mission to achieve flat stomach. So with all these complex situations what do you do? Go home and said it aloud.................. FUCK IT and ordered the yummiest stuff which is full of oil, spices, big chunks of meat and which taste flavourful. That's Bhuna Murg, Chilli chicken and Biryani for you. ( Chilli chicken in Mughlai?because like I said above fuck it) Food came in flat 37.23 yeah I had my watch set, ripped apart the packing and dug in. Good quantity, enough to shut me up and save some for the next day. Go take this guilt trip,order or dine in but Just don't tell your gym trainer about it.|negative
Rated A multi floored outlet of McDonald's and probably one of the few things which is functional inside the Nirmal Lifestyle mall! This outlet is quite old now but they have maintained their reputation as I have had no trouble with it till now!|negative
Rated When I think about Party and Chill out, my first priority is the Pop Tate's. This time we went to the Pop Tate's mulund outlet. Ambience and loud music was awasome. Food was simply awasome. Overall ratings: Food : 5/5 Ambience : 5/5 Service & Staff :4/5 Music : 5/5|negative
Rated Was here yest aftanoon with some friends meeting them after a long time..i reached a bit late so the order was already placed..v ordered a choco bloc pan cake..it was served with cream ice cream n chocolate sauce spread over the pan cake..it was good..but not outstanding..v wanted water and they said they only have mineral water bottles which is not what u expect from a cafe..overall a decent place..|negative
Rated The name can be a little deceptive, it has more to offer than just the chocolates . But everything is overlooked by chocolate varieties offered .I ordered chocolate brownie sundaes ,the potion was huge but the nut tasted funny . service people overlooked us(withe family) and gave preference to college students|negative
Rated Heard a lot about kirti mehal n decided to go for dinner with family!! But disappointed!! Food quality is not good.. The way they served us was pathetic.. There is no hygiene factor.. And on Sunday Eve.. Never visit!!! Pathetic!!! Waste of money!!|negative
Rated Visited this place a long back. This place was suggested by my friend. So after shopping time we decided to try it out. We ordered a sweet corn veg soup which was completely bland, no seasoning no taste at all. Also ordered veg crispy which was very oily that spoiled the taste of the food. Lost my appetite. Very disappointing experience.|negative
Rated Pizza hut was a go to place for pizzas, but somehow their pizzas seemed to have fizzled out over the years as far taste, quality and variety is concerned. Boring combos and even more boring pizzas. I don't know if I would ever want to visit this place again|negative
Rated Pathetic experience I had with this pizza joint. Only three tables were occupied for lunch including ours. Staff is lethargic and service is depressing. Couldn't believe it was the Pizza Hut experiences.|negative
Rated Ordered chk hyderabadi biryani- pics do justice. Rice seemed slightly inferior quality but overall the biryani was ok. Chk is with bone amd you will find about 4 curry cut pieces- for the uninformed thats smaller than the pieces you use at home. Little clueless why 1. They send a papad w the biryani, 2. They send pickle and 3. Why quantity of raita is disproportionately small Took about 30 minutes to deliver for a distance of about half a kilometer. Cost 200/-|negative
Rated The quality if service is very bad!!.. The quality of food is bad & quantity is also very less & prices are over charged!.. Overall review I would not suggest ppl if the quality if food & service remains unchanged.|negative
Rated Don't miss chicken 65 in vikas|negative
Rated Red velvet cake and chocolate cake from @pieceofcake_mumbai . One word:- SINFUL! Must try for all the vegetarians coz all their products are EGGLESS! They home deliver too! #livetoeat #livetoeatbombay #desserts #eggless #cakes #redvelvet #matunga|negative
Rated You know how sometimes you want a cake that you can smash on your friend's face on his birthday but the cake you've ordered is really expensive and very delicious and you don't want to waste it? That's when you come here.|negative
Rated Ordered from here for lunch. Didnt have any expectations- just pulled it out of the Zomato hat. Went with the Chk Triple Fried Rice which comes with a gravy as a lunch combo. The food was average- not the best, not the worst. I rate it a 3.0- the rating improved .5 because the order was here literally 15 minutes after I ordered. Could use a little less oil overall with the rice. The owner could be sweeter on the phone but that might be just a random miss and not a habit. Also tried the chk hakka noddles yesterday- downgraded to a 3.|negative
Rated Small simple place....a bit cramped at times when it get full to its capacity....decent stuff...tends to over-sweeten the sauces at times....good for a take away|negative
Rated S.S Chinese is this really small place and is kinda hard to find. It's that one place you can approach for cheap, good quality food. The delivery is kinda slow but worth the wait. Good to approach when you are extremely hungry and crave for cheap Chinese food!|negative
Rated S.S. Chinese is this lil place thats supposed to serve quick, off-you-go chinese cuisine at an extremely cheap rate at an amazing and unexpected yuminess. But it didn't really stand to anyone's expectations when it was tried for the first time. Firstly whatever I wanted to have was unavailable. May be that was not the right day or hour, so I ignore that fact. But even after the order was placed, it took quite sometime to deliver. The rice was dripping too much oil. The soup that was ordered, did not come. Instead it was replaced by sonething thats my least favoraite and extremely spicy. Totally an off.|negative
Rated This place I have visited once and a friend picked a parcel the other time..both times it was the Chocolate Ball. I have no freaking idea how does one find hair both the times and on different days. I don't know now how much of hair was given away like this.. It's really unhygienic and disgusting.|negative
Rated Hate it. Don't even think of going in. The cakes have no natural taste and everything in the cake feels like eating sweat chemicals. All chemical type smell in the cake. Very pathetic. Samosa could serve you better inside. Everything is exorbitantly priced|negative
Rated its totally expensive and the cakes are very hard its too damn flop think twice before you enter|negative
Rated A good place to drink. Cheap liquor. Most of the customers in Ratna palace are regular. Even if the smoking is not allowed inside, there is a space inside near kitchen where you can go and smoke. Overall it is not a place where you would come a long way to visit. But, definitely a place to chill if you live in Matunga west. And yes. you should definitely order neer dosa here. I like this place and visit here very often with my roommates. Cheers!|negative
Rated I think the food is extremely oily - I could not bear to see the noodles float in oil :( I think I can give this place a miss . The management also told me they don't do gravies only semi dry - who does that ?!|negative
Rated To be frank , The food is not as bad as the service. Ordered South Indian and it was standard fare. But the waiter stared , looked annoyed when we didn't order within 2 mins of him handing us the menu card and almost literally shooed as soon as he thought we were done . Nothing much to mention abt the ambience on the ground floor. Go to this place only if you have to.|negative
Rated Don't ever order for home delivery from this place. It will take mre then a hour to receive your order especially on Sunday's. It has moved to remote location. overall a very bad experience.|negative
Rated This ice cream parlour (which 90% of people misspell as 'Naturals') is one of the very few Bombay-based ice cream chains. The original Juhu one has been around since decades but even this Mahavir Nagar dates back to the time I was a kid. Average sized, it can fit around 10 people at a time. Interiors are done up in typical 'Natural' colours (pun intended). The 300dpi images of fruits and ice creams adorn their walls. Their flavours are as fruity as you could get, containing fragments of their respective fruits. My personal favourites include Tender Coconut, Sitaphal, Watermelon & Coffee Walnut. For a change, you can even have their Chocobite, which has choco chips in it. But because of their limited flavours, Natural can get a bit repetitive over a period of time. That's only where it falls short of the international brands.|negative
Rated Ordered chicken hakka noodles and chicken lollypop. Hakka noodles was fine though they make better lolly pop was a disaster they had over fried it dont go by its look its its bigger size is nothing but its coating with absolute zero moisture am disapointed .My mom orderd chilli chicken with extra chilli but was disapointed we had to ask the cook to re do it.|negative
Rated Binjal J Kapadia and me had a home delivery from this joint and it was as per instructions to the detail. (Less spicy Pav bhaji and less roasted dosa) The delivery was exactly on time and also has the option of minimum delivery of 100 rupees. This is going to be on my list of emergency food joints for home delivery for sure.|negative
Rated Singh Sahab is small set up placed on the busy lane going towards Chembur Camp....with well done interiors and ambience... Visited here with a bunch of friends... and had a not bad experience... Though we were a bit finicky about this place due to the mixed reviews on zomato... but didn't mind giving it a shot.... Food - 3.5/5 certain items were extremely good.... especially the biryani & kebabs however a few disappointed us as well. Amazing Presentation Ambience - 3/5 a bit congested... but not a major issue as well.... Music sucks... Crowd - You might get surprised meeting old friends. Guess it's become a favourite hangout for all Chemburites. VFM - Won't burn your pockets.... All in All one time visit place with an average rating of 3.5/5...|negative
Rated I had been avoiding this place for quite some time as there was a bad rumour bt them nt bein very good with veg food an on that they are way to expensive bull shit they have a lot f options in veg food and people who say it's expensive I think they are idiots cos a meal for 2 would cost u around 700 which is nt at all expensive for the quality n the quantity that they serve its a �?�?�?�?�? for me in all the aspects like food to ambience to service everything was just perfect they have alt f options in veg n there is nuthing till date tht I have eaten here n not liked it or I felt had n average taste.

Rated Lovely ambience, beware of mosquitoes! Hard to avoid Coz it's an open space. Soothing live music. And service on point. This place won't let u down!!|negative
Rated HORRIBLE PIZZAS AND SERVICE!!! I will never come back to this place again!! People steer clear from Papa John's!! There are better options nearby like pizza express, Pizza Hut and dominos.. This joint is a disgrace to the chain Papa John's.. No service!! I mean literally I had to go to the counter to place my order! The pizzas were cold and tiny! I felt like the joint was suffering from some kind of food shortage to serve petite pizzas.. Papa John's pizzas are not this small back in the US.. My dog could eat the entire pizza in one gulp.. They served us some kind of weird drink which was supposed to be 7up but tasted more like adulterated lime water! The only pizza I liked was the newly introduced Zaffran pizza but still the size of the pizza scandalised me! To make matters worse, the servers lie at Papa John's. We placed order for a takeaway of a medium pizza that would be served with a drink of our choice. We asked for 7up and later the servers come back telling us that they are out of 7up and when we asked for the other options available they told us that we could opt for Pepsi or Mirinda. Since we dislike Pepsi we chose Mirinda and guess what after a minute the server comes back informing us that they only have Pepsi available (Then why the hell did they tell us that we could Choose Mirinda????).They didn't even have plain mineral water to provide us in place of Pepsi IMAGINE A RESTAURANT WITOUT MINERAL WATER!! Shame on you guys!! Pathetic!!|negative
Rated Pathetic and rude steward . Went there , one of the tables was unoccupied . But it was out of balance a bit. This guy comes up and says please get up will give you another table , rather then fixing the same. Got up , waited 10/15 minutes searching for that person. No Table as the place was a bit crowded. Spoke to the manager , no reply ... So no chance of tasting Papa John's in Mumbai Will not visit that place ... Guys have attitude when they are full over to pizza Hut .. Cheers !!! prithvishashar.wordpress.com|negative
Rated Hoppipola is all about FUN.. deriving its name from the popular Icelandic song, which basically means "jumping into puddles", this popular franchise by Speciality Group always stays honest to its theme with all the colours, liveliness and playful spirits which helps you to unwind after a long day of work or in the weekends with games, music and crazy parties with friends till the point you doze off.. However, being an old patron to the Speciality Group outlets, I do have certain expectations and pre-conceived standards everytime I visit one of their outlets and and SADLY this place fails to live up to their own metrics.. Firstly the service is Pathetic to say the least..the server seems way too rude and the more crowd keeps coming in, the hospitality keeps dropping to the point of being non-responsive.. Also what I found they allowed people to enter exceeding the capacity of the place until you find people almost surrounding your table making it uncomfortable and stuffy..definitely not expected from a place like this.. Adding to it, the music was way too loud all the times and you can't even hear what the person adjacent to you is trying to say..Sports screening became a nightmare when we realise the whole screen has been blocked by people standing in front and dancing.. Still I would say the decor was differently done keeping in line with the theme, the toy plains and long lamps hanging from the ceilings and the wooden finish gives a good-old world like charm.. Being a gastro-pub, this place is more about its cocktails and liquor rather than its food, still the quality and quantity served was way below par compared to the prices charged..We had: Chicken Trilogy: This was supposed to be 3 different types of chicken skewers served in a palate as I have seen in the Kolkata outlet..sadly only one kind of skewers were served and they were way too sticky and chewy.. The Harissian Fish: Harissa paste is supposed to be an African spice, however I didn't sample anything african in this dish, though the fish skewers were well marinated and cooked to perfection..better than the rest.. Hot Chick: Basically a pan fried chilli chicken, devoid of the chillies, loved the assortment of capsicum and onions, but the chicken were too few in numbers and the dish lacked the usual punch.. Cheesy French Fries: I forgot the actual name of the dish, most probably Slider Hotato.. basically plain, naive french fries topped with a cheesy, creamy sauce.. Spank the Cock: Indeed quirky in its naming, sadly failed to live up taste-wise.. Grilled chicken served with mashed potatoes and a spicy deep, again the chicken seemed to lack seasoning and low on flavours.. Fudge Block: Something to cheer about at the end.. Brownie with Vanilla Ice cream, topped with chocolate sauce..atleast they can't go wrong with this one..phew.. Watermelon and Basil Mojito: Nice concoction of fruits and liquor, beautifully blended.. refreshing particularly during this heat waves.. Old Monk: They had a deal where they serve 180ml for just Rs.400/-.. economical indeed.. Overall this place fails to impress, and missed that WOW factor which pulls you back again.. Not a single dish we sampled tasted delicious or memorable.. Our total cheque comes to Rs.2635/-(all incl) for 4 people.. Food: 2/5 Pricing: 3.5/5 Service: 2/5 Ambiance: 3/5|negative
Rated This Powai outlet is a bit small and gets really really crowded as the evening proceeds on a weekend. The music is too loud and the service is sluggish. That's the reason for the 3 stars. No doubt the food quality is good, but the quantity is pretty less. The charm hoppipola once had of being a unique place is somehow fading, that's the vibe I got from this place. Initially it used to be like sit comfortably at your table, play different games, jengas especially and enjoy the company of your friends. But now the music is so loud it becomes almost impossible to communicate. That's a huge problem we as a group face when we visit hoppipola.|negative
Rated Wanted to try out the new Chizza but left disappointed. I literally fell for their ad. I thought I was supposed to get 4 pieces but just got 2. The cheese used was poor. In the end felt that the Chizza had nothing wow in it. The bucket was decent. Could have been more spicier.|negative
Rated Kentucky fried with an Indian twist your popcorn chicken is the best thing on the menu. I'm not a big fan of fried chicken I find the meat bland inside no flavour but these chicken bits are tasty masaledar fried to perfection.|negative
Rated Going to keep it short. - waiters were rude and inhospitable. Despite asking in Hindi they were replying in bangla. - they seemed to have no idea about the dishes. - some dishes we ate were not worth the price. Too small portions especially starters. - most of the stuff we ordered was unavailable and we had to settle on something else to fill our tummies. - definitely not going again..|negative
Rated Superb pasta, don't ever have the pot rice, not edible enough, shit and extremely sour and so much sugar in it. Shit is an understatement...|negative
Rated Rude lounge Powai, this one is different to its own branches specially because of its location. The ambience is stunning. Its rare restaurant that is non Ac yet any season is favourable. Reservation for evening is necessary specially if you want your choice of table with exotic view. Food is very decent, be it pizza or punjabi starters or sizzlers, all were good. This place is not that pricey as compare of other lounges. The big laid back is the service, it can mess up your hunger, our starters were over before drinks were serve. They need not be so rude in their service to justify its name. This is second time when its service was poor. The music is good but can get you hurting if you are not in cool type of mood.|negative
Rated Ambience - 4 Service - 4 Food - 3 For jain only al carte is available. Limited options but tasty. Ordered fried corn and paneer saute in starters. Fried rice and exotic vegetables in black bean sauce. Quantity was good and so was the price.|negative

Rated The dadar tibbs franky outlet is one of the oldest tibbs franky stall. It has a variety of frankies and wraps. The chicken franky is really good. Its a little expensive as it is a road side stall.|negative
Rated Compared to other Maroosh outlets, shivaji park one is extremely a let down in terms of service and good quality. If you go and eat there l, they make you wait for 40 min even if noone is there. If the chicken is uncooked and you complain, they just shrug the shoulders and say this is what it is. If you order home delivery that would be the worst of your life. They deliver after 2 hours and above that argue that it was ordered 1 hour 45 min ago. It seems the staff hates to work there and is hell bent to destroy the reputation of otherwise tasty franchise. #maroosh #marioshdadar|negative
Rated I was excited to have Chicken Hummus Salad and this came out as a big disappointment . I ordered it from this outlet , the chicken was burnt and stale like actually smelling , Lettuce were soggy, Hummus was less. I am never going back there.|negative
Rated Ice Cream Works is brought to you by the same people behind Cream Centre. When this brand started out, the ice creams were quite stellar in both quality and quantity. I ranked it above Gelato, Baskin and Amul. But somewhere down the line they lost plot and reduced quality and reworked the prices if you know what I mean. The mint Fudge has a little too much fudge than desired. It should aptly be named Fudge Mint. No puns intended. The mint is completely drowned in this concoction and starts feeling tasteless in comparison to the overwhelming quantity of Fudge. The old version had lesser fudge and stronger mint. The new version is reversed. Of the remaining flavors - Salted Caramel works well for me but I do suspect that even its flavor has been off in the past few months. This particular outlet needs to warn people that they send dry ice to keep ice creams cold. We accidentally touched the dry ice when emptying the bag as we thought it was regular ice. I would still pick Ice Cream works over Amul and Naturals but not over Apsara, Hokey Pokey, Baskin Robbins and Gelato. ============================================== Desserts 3/5 Pricing 3/5 Service 2/5 grubzone.blogspot.com|negative
Rated I had been there for dinner after a long tiring day. Not such nicely decorated place but so-so. Chinese food was so pathetic, ordered for hakka noodles and it taste like hell a noodles.. Very tasteless and half cooked almost. I guess it was first and last Chinese order there for me.|negative

Rated A place where you can chill with your friends is Barista. Located in shivaji park, is frequently visited by us. I go here only to have dark temptation. This desert is one of a kind. A deliciously warm brownie with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sause. It a perfect desert to lighten your mood.|negative

Rated The original Sachin seems to have been lost on commercials. The food was extremely bland, watery gravy and with no salt. The chicken, one could easily make out was stale. The chapati was cold and dry. Not a place to to enter again. BAD|negative
Rated Due to the long wait at Jai Hind me n wifey headed to Hotel Sachin. After ages we entered this place. Ordered for promfret chapati and chicken sukhe thali. Before ordering the promfret fry had told the server we want tawa fry and he confirmed but when it was Served it was deep fried. Minus point.....don't lie. Chapati was very very sad. Chicken sukhe was average nothing great. Didn't get any kick to visit this place again.|negative
Rated Amzing resto with classical interior Tried kings beer Almost fallen for that Amzing creativity with the presentation of items they present|negative
Rated After discussing much about where to have drinks in Dadar, we finally ended up here. We didn't get our choice of liquor. We still thought of giving this place a shot. We ordered Cheesy French Fries for starters. It was good as it should be, and we got excited. So we ordered few more dishes. They had Kheema Pav in 'Bar Food' menu. It tasted okay. Cheese Balls with Sriracha Sauce were pathetic. They served Chicken Lollipop with veggies when we ordered Drums of Heaven. It was disappointing. Chinese food was quite mediocre too. Service was okay for what it's worth. Overall, a mediocre place with pointless name and unworthy food.|negative
Rated Ordered a home delivery at 12....still waiting.....person at the counter is useless...says he left for delivery when i had called at 12... same at 12 50......it takes 15 mins from shivaji park to my place....Never again|negative
Rated The decoration and the interior design was damn awesome. Had Get Chocolaty Pastry and Ret Velvet Pastry.. They were really frozen and should actually have been heated up a bit before serving.. When asked.. They almost burnt it.. The chocolate almost melted and in the Red Velvet... It tasted disgusting after it was heated up.. It doesn't even have anything else except cakes.. Like light bites or something which is a negative thing about it.!! Those 3 stars just for the ambience.. Overall.. Thumbs Down.!|negative
Rated I was craving chicken tandoori one afternoon. Sadly, this is the only place that nearby that actually offers that at the time. It was a disappointment. The chicken was completely burnt, even after I told them how I wanted it. I bought quite a bit since I'm a good eater and to top it off I was hungry. I spent quite a bit, and I ended up throwing the entire thing and worst of all still hungry. Never going there again.|negative
Rated Worst chinese food I have ever had..... Manchow soup was watery and tasteless.. Chings 10 Rs. Packet instant soup far more better than this soup... I had ordered veg crispy and they served me chicken crispy... Food - 3/10, Ambience - 4/10, Service - 5/10.. Very very bad expirence.|negative
Rated Very very bad experience of last 2 times, 1st ordered for a veg wonk which was good along with it paneer chili was ordered which was brought too late and instead of paneer chicken chilli was handed over and thanks to god grace that we realised before tasting it and then due to their apology I tried to go to the place once more yesterday and yet again it disappointed very much, one full large meal was ordered which included wok, dimsums and ice tea. Ice tea was brought 20min late, then wok was brought 45 mins late and that too was made inappropriate then it was changed and it took another 15 min and the wait was not at all worth also bcoz it didnt tasted that good and till our wok finished it was already 1 and a half hour till we had given order and still dimsums were not brought so i told him not to bring it after so long waiting and finally as a gesture he gave me 20Rs DISCOUNT which was there reimbursement of all thetime wasted and useless and when I asked the waiter to call manager or owner, he told me that owner was too busy and can't meet so i dont think that now I will dare to take a step inside this place again and would recommend u all to not go to the place as its too bad........|negative
Rated Worst Chinese place to eat. They make any shit and call it Chinese! I ordered for crispy chicken and Korean noodles and the food had more color than anything bright! Its okay if I wasted money over it, worse part was i had to waste that inedible food. I couldn't gulp one spoon down my throat!|negative
Rated I was craving for fried momos. I went there. They only had steamed ones. I asked the chef, who was a guy in baniyan, sweating if they served fried momos. He said yes, so I waited unwillingly. After 15 min waiter brought me a plate of dimsums, may be the staff didn't even knw the difference. The presentation looked poor. I knew it was going to be a hell of experience. Also he made it by frying already steamed momos. Who does that !!! Oil started dripping from it as I took one and bit. Yukk.. Half of it was filled with oil. Couldnt dare to have another bite. Left seat and had to pay 160/- for that. Never went again.|negative
Rated Went for lunch, ordered chicken chatpata, it felt more of normal fried chciken than, chatpata. Had ordered rice bhakri which was again half cooked, even egg masala which had watery curry, not upto the mark. The service was slow, had to ask several times to waiter for fried noodles, for my kid.|negative
Rated Do Zomato have negative rating? If it had a option, I would have rated it in the negative. This place has deteriorated beyond control. The waiters are arrogant, snobbish, poorly trained ( before you take the table, they ask for order). This place at best can be described as a shady watering hole for the frustrated souls. The family section is a farce. The only family groups visiting this place are the ones who do not stay in the vicinity. A menace to the neighborhood since the tipsy guys create a ruckus regularly. Please stay away !!|negative
Rated Their pav bhaji... Chicken crispy and cheese and garlic naan is what i can rave for lifelong... Nice place to hang out casually with family... Gets crowded on weekends...|negative
Rated This is a family dinner place typically with same old boring interiors. There are two sections: air conditioned and non air conditioned. It is not an expensive place. North Indian food is good and other cuisines are value for money though never tried desserts. There is a screen so can go during matches. However, this place needs a total revamp in terms of ambiance.|negative
Rated We were damn hungry so wanted a quick bite. Came across this hotel which is bang opposite to Sanjay Gandhi National Park. We ordered Pav Bhaji and Misal Pav as it's the quickest to prepare but it took quite a long time to come in spite of the hotel being empty. Food was not bad. Service was average. Decent place with affordable price rate.|negative
Rated Worst dosa I have had in my life. They served it fc.k.in cold. Just walked away.|negative
Rated Review 2 - Revisited recently. On insisting that the past experience wasn't up to the mark the waiters and the chefs ensured a beautiful mutton kheema. Guess my friends weren't wrong after all. +1 Review 1 - Aha. Borivalis own watering hole. Situated on the road which leads one to the station from the highway this place could be missed (if not for a strong stench of liquor, the whiff of which might force an alcohol lover to pry). Generally cursed by the passer by for its abrupt location, it bottlenecks the wide road. -0.5 on the city planning. Once inside there are 3 partitions - Polluted air, fan in a room and the prestigious AC room. The division of society on monetary lines is quite obvious here. It's moderately lit, attracts the post work - pissed with life crowd, the regulars (colony uncles who with big blood shot eyes who at the drop of a hat start giving Gyan), the chronic alcoholics (who love to abuse once on their trip) and people who love getting knocked out. Ordering anything less than a quarter here is considered as an insult by the staff who are generally slow and seem drunk themselves. Once you have taken it all in, you glance at the food menu. The dry garlic chana is a delightful dish. +1. Try the chicken koliwada. However the mutton kheema, though lauded by my friends, was not up to the mark. One could only taste the onion tomato masala and no mutton. There is no music, just that little television screening going in loop. Dull. But that's not the idea when one comes here. Overall cheap according to the AC standards also. PS - Be prepared to be nagged by Mr. Hegde after you write a review.|negative
Rated CP used to be good when people were short of options. However, if you ever slip into economy mode you would want to consider this bar. The waiters here are at times rude and careless. The management seriously need to train their staff. The food again is average. The main course specially. Starters again, OK_OK|negative
Rated I have ordered food from here and always took the parcel.. There is no doubt about the taste as these guys make awesome sea food dishes .No separate area for people who drink so its bit difficult to have dine there with family. Must try : Bombay duck fry , prawns fry , lepe fry|negative
Rated Sanjog is a typical restaurant & bar & no matter whenever you visit this place is always crowded. Place is located just outside boriwali east station makes it very viable option for people who are in haze of having quick drink. Place is old but specious inside they have too many tables must be accommodating more than 50 - 60 people appx Service is fast & staff is just ok. They have quarter system also. Dont know why they promote thumps up as dilute & no Coco Cola which was funny.|negative
Rated I,ve frequently been in this place which is a good restaurant and bar for a long time now. But I was shocked today when the below scenario happened with my friend and i- We ordered a starter and some drinks. The service is quick and the quantity was also enough for the two of us. The starter got cold after 30 -45 mins of it being served so I requested first to the waiter for it to make it little warm or hot as we were unable to eat it. He straight away said no. Then I requested to the manager and then the owner, all of them directly rejecting me for my request. The excuse that they gave, we don't accept these requests is bcoz the food is now already eaten which was a big turn off. As a restaurant they should keep an oven or if nothing else they should learn how to skillfully say no. They can't b so rude for such a request.|negative
Rated Awful food.... People on other tables also complaining about food quality. Dont ever go here for food. As far the bar is concerned it was ok an spacious.|negative
Rated Just ordered food. Absolutely stale. The worst Butter Chicken I have ever tasted. Chicken used in Tandoori and Kebab not at all fresh. Horrible food. Maybe the people who eat there are too drunk to take notice.|negative
Rated Our Savior on * maid not coming day* Its known for its real steep prices. By steep I mean killer steep. Where else do you get food for 120-200 bucks that would be more than enough for 3 people. The Soups are tasty. Things made well without fail - Triple Shechzwan , Hakka Noodles , Chopseuy , Fried Rice. Keep it simple & enjoy the tasty cheap food that does not hurt your stomach & wallet|negative
Rated I don't know why i am giving it even 1.0 rating. I literally flushed all of its manchurian as it was so bad. Please please only visit this place only if you have no other option left.|negative
Rated Please learn a lesson known as "Punctuality".. Food is never on time! Packing of home delivery food is not in a proper conditions! If you order sandwich or idli from them they will send in 20-25min without using any plastic sheet.. whole sandwich & idli was stuck into news paper. Congested place.. No ambience.. just eat & go.. Careless behaviour of waiters.. least bother to hear you at once & take order's .. Quality of food is Average or you can call below average if you are ordering something in Chinese.. Quantity is too less! Please dont order any briyani because it's just coloured rice with hardly left over vegetables which is available with them..|negative
Rated Very ordinary place. Very limited sitting area. Order takes a while since they make garlic bread and pizza in a household electric tandoor. Food was OK. Not bad but nothing great either.|negative
Rated If I could give half a rating, I totally would. We were so impressed by the looks of this restaurant when we entered that we were sure of having a hearty meal. Really hungry at 10.30 pm, we walked into a busy restaurant and started looking at the menu. Finally ordered a dish of chicken and roti, with dal fry and jeera rice. In the meantime, my mom was thirsty so she ordered a fresh lime juice. It was a disaster! It wasn't even close to cold, the sugar syrup was wayyyyy too much for our liking, and it wasn't 'fresh' as such! 15-20 mins waiting time is still okay, but we waited for more than 45 minutes and the food had still not arrived at 11.30 pm. When it finally arrived after we had almost made up our mind to leave, the food lacked salt and was tasteless! We had no choice but to eat it, but honestly, it was too expensive for the quality they offered. I'm never going back to this hyped restaurant!|negative
Rated We were craving for food and greens was the nearest pure veg restaurant so decided to check it out. It was a Sunday and the place was crowded. Its much closer to the road and thus is very noisy. The ambience is nothing to shout about. We ordered pav bhaji, potato fingers, spring roll and malai kulfi. The service was quick but not at all organized. The pav bhaji came with no chopped onions with it so we had to notify the waiter for the same. The pav bhaji and dosa were average in terms of taste. The potato fingers were nothing to complain about. The spring rolls were extra salty and we just ate the crisp cover and threw the filling. The malai kulfi was a great relief. Also, there was a mistake in the bill as they charged us for malai kofta instead of malai kulfi. Overall a very bad experience. Taste: 3/10 Service: 4/10 Ambience: 4/10 Value for money: 4/10|negative
Rated Very basic kind of place. Staff is frustrated and unhygienic. The whole place is dirty and AC section is cramped and smells badly. Don't go ...don't even think of...No No No|negative
Rated Worst restaurant. These guys have no decency in their language nor they care for their business. Dont even try to go. You ll be disappointed. Deserves a 0 rating.|negative
Rated Absolute rubbish... Had ordered biryani and all it had was heaps of stale coriander with the stalks... I couldn't even chew it or push it down my throat... It had too much artificial color added...the chicken pieces looked too red... It killed my appetite.|negative
Rated Poor customer relationship. I order from them minimum thrice a week and they deny my home delivery order coz i was ₹10 short on the minimum order. Seriously?!|negative
Rated Yummiest home made cakes ever tasted . ow n d customized cup cakes to die for n customized birthday cakes make birthday's even more awsm n spl|negative
Rated The most crowded outlet in cypress.. Their juices r just wow and the quantity is good for the prices they charge. During summer if u visit cypress, then u must try a juice here to quench ur thirst. KitKat, mango, sitafal milkshakes r my favourites. They also have a south Indian restaurant in d adjacent shop which has a limited menu. Their food and service are average.. I happened to order idli and vada sambhar dis morning and i received my order in half hour. The sambhar tasted very different today and I could just have a spoon. It was stale and had horrible taste. However this was my first bad experience at karthik, usually their sambhar is average.. The chutney is a lil thin but has an ok taste.. The vadas were cold.. I would suggest to tell them to provide u wid hot vadas wen u visit the restaurant o have home delivery.. Further, they do not have any minimum order so if u want to order breakfast for 1 person then this restaurant is suitable. Im giving a 4 star for the juice section, the south Indian outlet gets a 2 star.|negative
Rated Long ago, a friend and I made plans to have lunch at The Nutcracker, a little predominantly vegetarian outlet in a by-lane of Kala Ghoda. When we arrived, there was such a long wait list and the place looked so tiny, that we decided to give it a miss. But being unable to visit a coveted restaurant after earmarking it is like being unable to read a book after purchasing it. I knew I’d come back some day. That day was today. ... Read full post on trailstainedfingers.com|negative
Rated I'm not really happy with the experience in Nutcracker. My expectations were quiet high for their food, as I've heard a lot about it. The ambiance is average, wooden ceiling and wooden furniture, looks pretty good. It's very small place with limited seats. I visited this place on Sunday during kala ghoda festival, so had to wait for 10 mins as all tables were occupied. The menu doesn't have much to offer, and they have limited options. We ordered cold coffee, nutty spaghetti, and veg panini. Nutty spaghetti disappointed to a great extent. Taste was confusing & almonds, cashews killed the actual taste of this dish. Veg panini was average, served with hummus. I'm not really sure if I'll visit nutcracker again because they don't have something different to offer. Cheers.!|negative
Rated Go here for their nachos with refriedbeans! Ironically this Mexican dish is to die for in this Italian joint. We tried the risotto barbaresca which was very good,what I found a bit too tangy and hard to finish was melanzane alla parmigiana. Don't forget to ask for the drinks menu all the mocktails are very interesting. The restaurant is a little too expensive,I guess it's because of the location.|negative
Rated A very small but historic place. Damn crowded and no special sitting arrangements. U have to take ur parcel and seat outside bakery under tree shadows. But thumbs up to all bakery dishes. Must try...|negative
Rated After a hectic tour at Chandigarh, I was back in the city to host a sit and draw competition for kids at the Phoenix MarketCity Kurla. After the event was over by 1:30pm, me and my team planned to have a quick discussion regarding our upcoming mega event over a lunch party. Couldn't afford to travel any further, we thought of experimenting the Kashmiri food. The ambiance inside is impressive indeed, with shikara and curtains and cozy sitting arrangements. But, the one which strikes at the very entrance is a burnt smell. It may have been happened only that day, unlucky me, but, it was pretty predominant. Probably that's the sign to me, warning me about the discomfort coming up. We 5 took a cabin, and were glancing at the menu card. The names were totally unfamiliar, so we went through the visuals of the menu. We found a lady in charge, who came forward to assist us in giving the order. She confirms that a thali is limited, but can be shared across the table. The rates seems bit towards the higher side, and keeping in mind the quantum of hunger which we had to satisfy, we planned for a veg and a non veg thali. The other reason behind it was to take a quick taste of a wide range of the recipes. It took a hell lot of time for them to serve. The restaurant was not at all that much crowded, which may take them so much. But when the thali arrived, it was a big disappointment in everyone's mind. The rice quantity was tiny, so tiny that the total number of steamed rice can be easily counted. The sabzi however seemed in line with the visuals at the menu card. We immediately called the lady, and expressed the discomfort. She clarifies, extra rice may be ordered over extra payment. But, she didnt bother to reply why in thali the rice is so less. Honestly, it wont even feed a 2 year old kid. We ordered a steamed rice plate. Apart from the mutton, all the sabzi were very much non spicy, unable to give any pleasure to the taste buds. The ordered rice plate was also not at all sufficient for an adult. When we shared the discomfort to that lady manager, she seemed to be pretty reluctant. Meanwhile, we overheard the similar complaints from the neighboring tables as well. Last came the firni. I bet, this is not firni. The worst desserts ever tasted. I don't mind paying bit more for a dine out, but I seriously felt we were bluffed and fooled that day, with not even minimum decorum or hospitality towards the customer. Disgusted me, will never recommend anyone for this restaurant. Rather, there is one thing I must say to all who are planning to visit...BEWARE.|negative
Rated It's HOLI and we don't have a HOLIday. With less outlets open during day hours, we wished to order our lunch at work. Surprisingly, Tao9 haa no delivery service from Powai to Vikhroli-West. The only option left was ASIAN WOK. What we ordered: Stir Fry All Veg Bowl. It was served on a bed of Hakka Noodles topped with zucchini, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions and cabbage cooked in a sauce of Chilly Garlic and accompanied with Chilly Vinegar and Schezwan Sauce. Good taste. Filling quantity. Quick suggestion: Give plastic spoons, forks and tissue with the delivery (might have just missed for our delivery)|negative
Rated Good food. Terrible service at this branch. Extremely slow service. Waited 20-25 min between each course. No one cleared used plates until reminded several times. As told by the server, dessert was phirni n gulab jamun. He served us a stale pastry n gulab jamun. On asking he said it's a replacement. Later he went n got some phirni. No one came with the bill for 30 min after food. We walked out without paying. Not one staff noticed. Terrible terrible service. Manager Mr. Srikant was clueless. And did not even know how to talk. Will never come back to this branch.|negative
Rated I generally try to root for the underdog and more often than not end up regretting my instinct. Opted for Garcia 's over the more reliable Smokin Joes and Domino's and called for the Garcia 's Spicy (Veg.) Pizza having a schezwan sauce base. We hit a jarring note right at the first bite, the schezwan sauce was pungent (dunno whether it was a weird recepie or the sauce was fusty - I suspect more of the latter ) and so nothing else mattered coz all the toppings and cheese were overpowered by the defiling sauce. We barely ate the pizza, I'm wiser by the experience.|negative
Rated One of the first pizza delivery chains in town before dominos became a standard. I used to regularly order the 10 incher cheese onion pizza and finish it on my own. Its a disaster not nothing works the base is awful, cheese even udipi pizzas use better quality cheese (hyperbole) this outlet is dark and dingy and looks unhygienic.|negative
Rated i had very bad experience with you guys on 6 tuesday oct i order chicken fierry pizza and meat lover pizza i mention at time of ordering i want chicken in meat lover pizza the person said yes but delivery was quick my cousin were just about to eat the pizza they were shock to see chicken bit reddish then we doubt it is pork then i call the outlet they told they do not serve pork it is chicken then i call again i said it pork please send a delivery and take it away after half an hour i receive a call from shop their chef said there is some mistake and it is pork and they replace the pizza after hour but my cousin went to her home cos it was late and whole mood of party was spoil i will think twice before ordering from you guys this happen at shivaji park outlet feeling sad because i am ordering from last seven years and this is what i got|negative
Rated What started out as the go-to Chinese takeout place in Prabhadevi has turned into the last resort on a rainy day. The quantity has decreased to a miserably insufficient amount, the food is largely greasy and delivery is terribly slow.|negative
Rated Best value for money Chinese delivery in mumbai. For an unusual but tasty dish try the minced chicken with aubergine schezwan style. unusual no? I know, but try it.|negative
Rated Disaster! It has never been a case when I have ordered a very basic sub online and they haven't messed up the order. I get a confirmation call about the order and then they disappeared for 1hr 10mins, after which they send me a wrong order! Even when ordered over the phone, the person taking the order is always confused and have no clue or rather pretends that he didn't hear you. 2-3 extremely bad experiences have made me a Subway hater.|negative
Rated This subway has nice sitting arrangement. But the place is very small. And the staff is very poor. They don't even know the sausage. They don't even all breads and veggies. Very very poor service.|negative
Rated The one star was earned by the lone server who seemed to care that I wasn't served armpit for dinner. Every time I go, the service here reaches a new low. And the 0.5 for the otherwise flawless years of service that Subway has (with the exception of this outlet) provided, across COUNTRIES. I remember one day as a broke student in NYC, where the only filling meal I could afford was a sub. First, they seem to be the least bit interested in actually serving you. Second, when you do manage to get their attention, they are distracted to unacceptable levels. I declined three veggies and asked for extra olives, the completely unaware server first refused. I was hungry, I asked them to charge me extra for it, he refused to add any on even for extra charge. At this point, my friend just cancelled his order. I persevered. That's when two random men (presumably friends of the manager) came in, cut the line and proceeded to loudly place their order. It took five minutes of fuming for them or the Subway peeps to realise there was something wrong with that. Then while one server was preparing my order, the other one leant over it to reach into the depths of the meet container, dipping the sleeve of his shirt into my subway in the process. When I expressed my disgust, they even asked me if I would like to change the sub and get another one. It would have been ridiculously funny, had it not been so disgusting. Please open another subway and start some healthy competition amongst people who work here, otherwise, please change the management for the place!|negative
Rated Went here for the Onam special thali and for some weird reason service was despicably slooooow. The place wasn't packed and we went in at about 22:30. Food finally came to us by 23:15. The thali was decent but left me wanting. Food was tasty but lacked a certain zing. A big shout out to Victor who plays the guitar moving from table to table. He's there on weekends and is a delight to hang out with. He belts out classic rock songs from the 60's to the 90's. It was very funny when a young teenager asked her to play Miley Cyrus.|negative
Rated Bad delivery experience, wrong order deliver, Instead of Veg Biryani...... Nonveg Biryani and the representative says it's good for you that you are getting non veg Biryani in rate of Veg one.... Such a Insane..... I have stopped visiting this restaurant.|negative
Rated Zomato rating is misleading. This is a take away joint......spicy greasy tasteless food the worst you can get. Stay away if you prefer a bit of tadka garnish nearby will do the job|negative
Rated Positives - Awesome taste, lot of cuisine s and great value for money restaurant. Drawbacks - Mediocre ambiance. Extremely crowded in the afternoons. Slow service. But I believe that the positives far outweigh the drawbacks, especially if you want to have an economc tasty meal.|negative
Rated Tried the DD naughty Lucy chicken & spicy grill chicken burger and must say what an overpriced poor immitation of a burger joint/coffee shop/donut shop. Been to several Dunkin donuts stores in the UAE and the US but this sadly is a badly executed dunkin donuts brand for the country. Don't be fooled by the huge sized burgers in the menu, in actual these burgers are way smaller than any proper burger such as burger king (btw burger king is a brilliant example of how a world famous burger brand can adopt to regional tastes and popularity to come up with some ingenious burgers like the chicken tandoori burger and good size of burgers as well !! ) Where the hell can one find a donut shop that has run out of donuts with couple of stale donunts for name sake. They seem to be more intrested in selling burgers and wraps than their mainstay product that is donuts. Understandable they must have run out of them for the day but having to try their Rs 260/burger made me realize what an average,overpriced quality of a mediocre burger from dunkin donuts.|negative
Rated Ordered at 10.30pm and made an online payment. Food never come and nobody picked up calls lost 11pm. Literally took our money & didn't even provide food.|negative
Rated & it's all about maggi... Service - 3/5 Food - 4/5 This place would give an orgasm to maggi lovers. Cheese lovers, do try 3cheese maggi. Place is too small to accommodate a large group. If you are planning to go in a group, you would probably have to split and sit in a group of 4max at a time.|negative
Rated + Quick service + Cheap dishes + Individual portions + Unique menu + Hygienic for roadside stall standards - Not large group friendly - Limited sidewalk seating|negative
Rated Worst experience. Completely unhygienic. They don't serve any authentic taste. Don't go and save yourself. Bad ambience. Foul smelling paneer.|negative
Rated Nothing special about the place. The quantity of kebab pieces served on a plate definitely doesn't demand the kind of bucks they charge, considering it's just a stall we are eating at, and the kind of pricing in neighbouring joints. Limited menu, forgettable taste.|negative
Rated Absolutely distasteful food. We ordered for biryani, cut lets and roll and nothing was in par with Bengali food. Can't explain how dry was the biryani and the chicken was just disgusting. Just one bite and you can't it take any more.|negative
Rated Had I got an option to rate 0, I would have given it to this place. I am currently sitting at my home after ordering from this place since more than 2 hrs. Neither I have any status of the order or the restaurant takes numerous of call I have attempted in an hour. Extremely callous attitude with unacceptable service. Disgusting place, there is no way an order cannot reach a place within 60-70 minutes. Update - Received the food after 2 hrs 40 mins, the restaurant was only giving excuses over one call that they attended. Food was cold, portion was less, no good experience to consider.|negative
Rated I ordered the combo while at work. The bad? The messed up with the kebab I ordered and what was delivered. Other than that, nice packaging, good delivery time. The food could do with a little bit more flavour, the spices lacked zing resulting in there biryani being a bit bland. Continental biryani?|negative
Rated The outlet is designed mainly to cater as takeaway and delivery, since they have only 4 tables. The kitchen looked to be hygienic. And the presentation too was good. The taste makes use of premixes known. Though I have no complaints on the biryani, I wish the chicken in the rolls was a little more cooked. Prices are on the higher side compared to pets which largely due to the procedures they have set. No harm in ordering again.|negative
Rated My experience was very bad. Food arrived after 2 hours though the our home was only a km or less from their Chandivali outlet. Out of 4 dishes we ordered, crispy shrimp was average but the others (including their chef's recommended list in the menu) were not well prepared & too spicy. The taste was almost like some cheap roadside food joint or even worst than that. One more point to be noted, when you call to order, they pick up your phone but when the order doesn't reach you in time & you call them up to inquire about the delay, they don't pick up your calls. I had to call up the zomato helpline to reach them.|negative
Rated Just had my order..a box of noodles and some veg salad. It was delivered after 1.5 hours and the outlet would not answer my call for an order update after the first time. Also, some veges were definitely stale. I've eaten Chinese food and because of the sauces it smells and tastes funny but the salad was off and I had to throw the whole thing away. The noodles had no taste but chilli. I get spicy and I like spicy but this was just ridiculous. Way too much sauce for the other flavors to come out. Fat chance I will eat from them again which is a pity because they have a good spread but the execution or perhaps the team at chandivali is not concerned about offering it right.|negative
Rated BEWARE - this is not the real moti mahal and is a franchise ! Run very badly ! The real moti mahal ppl should take notice of this or else their brand image is going for a toss . Chicken starters overcooked and too chewy ! More like Rubber chicken . Butter chicken --- tooo sweet and chicken overcooked Mutton punjabi masala - bland taste mutton cooked poorly Butter Naan was uncooked .. Overall - Bad Food �?|negative
Rated I ordered first time from this restaurant. I ordered paneer manchurian dry and aloo paratha. I got two stone in paneer manchurian and taste of paratha was very bad. I will never suggest anyone for this restaurant.|negative

Rated Please treat this as a notice issued for public welfare. This definitely takes the cake for the worst food ever. Ordered a mysore masala dosa, paneer pakoda, medu vada and sweet lime soda. Trust me, it is very difficult for a cook to get all of these wrong. These are very basic dishes that even a road side vendor would cook with good taste. My verdict is that this is definitely the worst restaurant in Chandivali, Mumbai. Please do not order. Wish there was a rating below 1.|negative
Rated The worst pizzas ever! The service is appalling. I can possibly dish out a better pizza looking at YouTube! I don't think your tummy needs this torture.|negative
Rated There is absolutely no place to sit! The service is very very bad. The people taking orders have no idea how to take orders. The pizzas are average and of course are not able to compensate for the poor management! If you have any coupons, they just don't accept them! Try dominos instead of this place.|negative
Rated The nearest pizza joint from my home, Pizzas are good, but never ever order from them if you have a bulk order, I made this mistake once at the last moment even after reminding them a day before whenni called up at the delivery time they say " Sorry sir we don't have any such order " Seriously this is the way you serve your customers? I had to go the place myself and had to give some harsh words leading them to complete the order in 15 mins and delivering it half an hr late. It was a Very BAD experience for me. Pizza Hut is better than this.|negative
Rated Their staff is pathetic. They do not know how to talk to a customer. They don't deliver items on time even if u are 15 mins away from them. When u enquire about the same they bang the phone down on you!|negative
Rated Always a delight to order from and always on time. Plus point: they don't put only three olives, pickles etc. They add more than that. Only downside, sometimes their cookies are very hard.|negative
Rated Bad experience.. The bread was not feeling right also they sent me the wrong chips along with my sandwich and the sandwich was not packed properly. Also when asked for the receipt they always have this excuse of printer not working.|negative
Rated disgusting shutt this rubbish franchise down, horrible , the manager is a illiterate surgeeth , cutting cost cold stale bread.less meat, im going to make sure i shutt this down|negative
Rated Avoid, at any cost, even if you have to stay hungry. Pathetic. You'll start hating Subway sandwiches if you have one from here. They'll put only tomatoes and lettuce irrespective of what you've ordered. Even those veggies are stale and in poor quantity.|negative
Rated My worst Subway experience. The bread was ice cold, so was the vegetables, tuna and chicken. They didn't even bother to mention which of the four subs is veg!! None of us could complete it and had to throw away!!!|negative
Rated Foul smelling Stale Unfriendly Un hygienic Can't customize on phone orders to save their life Have had TOO many bad experiences so won't recommend|negative
Rated Attracted by the big, flashy billboard I went there around 11 in the morning to grab some rolls but they were not functioning. After reading all the bad reviews I am not even interested in trying it. They lost an entire office customers for life!|negative
Rated Took at least 1 hr to deliver and served shit. Paneer kabab is chunks of paneer plain with masala sprinkled. And spmeone should learn to make the worst parathas ever from these guys.. No fillings at all.. I am disheartened to see how they sell this in the name of authencity..!! Not even worth trying once|negative
Rated I had ordered a black forest cake total bill was of rs 275 but after few mints got call from cake shop saying I have to pay 310 ,etc being delivery charges. Why should I pay more that of bill amount if delivery was chargable why the bill amount shows 275.why shop is asking for than the bill amount. @ I feel cheated here.|negative
Rated Extraordinarily bad customer service experience. I am glad I did not order the cake as I am pretty sure that it would have been equally bad. They said that they will charge Rs200 extra for home delivery of cake at an apartment about 1 kms far. Plus they will not make the delivery unless someone comes and pays in full in advance. Most unhelpful and unprofessional customer service. Either they are complacent or they just don't care.|negative
Rated The food is subpar as per the price they charge. The staff is highly unprofessional and rude. Wanted to swipe my card but couldn't cause even with a pos machine they wanted cash for a bill amount of 600. The owner started to fight over this small issue :/|negative
Rated Visited the outlet many times as my daughter likes the chocolate shot avaiable here. Over all quiet place and no much crowd outlet. You will have peacefull time. The items will be limited, one of the most moving item in most ccd outlet is smoked chicken sandwich. The other cold milkshakes are average.no card payments which is one negative point|negative
Rated One of the worst experiences at coffee day. 3 as but all out of order. Menu listed a combo but server denied that they serve that. When insisted he admitted he wasn't aware they served it & confirmed it's not available. When asked for anituer item it was available either. When fully ordered a couple of items they wouldn't accept credit card saying it was out of order. asked for a feedback from atlas 5 times nd got reply yes sir will give it but cannot find it. Finally someone with sense arrived who accepted the cr card as the other person didn't kn hw 2 use so simplicity had refused. Again asked for feedback from to new person & was told they don't hv it. The coffee served was comparable to cold coffee I make at home so felt like waste of money nd no good experience|negative
Rated I have been ordering from this place for almost last 15 years.. It was initially called chopstick. Back then chopstick delivered superb, aromatic Chinese food. Egg fried rice, hakka noodles and chicken manchurian being the best However over a period of time the food quality has drastically changed.. For worst! Be prepared to wait for nothing less than an hour and half for t food to be delivered..this holds true even if you stay 5 mins away from the restaurant. The food no more tastes or smells the way it did few years back It's a pity..|negative
Rated Worst ever food ..... Ordered chicken mughloi ..... It was really very bad .....so I just everyone to not to order from this restaurant never ever|negative
Rated We used to order a lot from vidiths when we were staying in Chandivali.. We have tried pomfret fry n curry, bangda fry, chicken fried rice, and various chicken gravy dishes.. Mutton we generally did give it a try Buh found there was only bones.. Can't blame them since they are dirt cheap.. They are very reasonable, quality of food is good, delivery is prompt, the fish items we ordered were all fresh.. Definitely miss this place!|negative
Rated Expensive chaats and mithai, but they're worth it. Maybe they charge a premium for the brand name, I don't know, but I guess it's ok. This is my regular pani puri / dahi puri haunt, and his "teekha" version of pani puri doesn't burn your throat like the other hardcore chaat-wallahs.|negative
Rated Most of the sweets are old. Two times took motichur ladoo 450rs/kg n found fungus on them. Funny n arrogant stuff n they will not accept ticket restaurant n money combo..very reluctant n bad behaviour. Snacks n sweets are subject to health risk. Someone should call Mumbai health authority to visit them once. Worst in Chandivali.|negative
Rated The sweets are really tasty..Though little over priced..In The morning i had idli sambar vada,and u will be unhappy with their sizes,coz they r so small..Dosa was okay.. And one more thing,sometimes dey charge u taxes on 'kacha bill'.Dont pay on it,instead insist on computer generated invoice..|negative
Rated Average food. Ordered methi mutter malai and biriyani. Biriyani was one of the worse ones I've had with a lot of oil. The gravy was nothing to write home about. Not going to be a regular here!|negative

Rated Brought aloo gobi today from this restaurant for dinner. Food was completely spoiled and I am sure that they had given yesterday's food. Last time I had mutton here, was shitty. I thought I would try it out again but food was even worst.|negative
Rated Just dont bother even entering or ordering from this place.... They cant make normal rolls and their biryani ( sarcastic laughter ) is worst then that u wud get from a slum based eatery...!!!! Disgusting....|negative
Rated Horrible place, order at risk of being starved. Here's the timeline of my order processing (that was eventually not even delivered): 1508 hrs: Placed for 1 full egg biryani 1630 hrs: Order still undelivered so I call back. The guy at the other end keeps giggling because he misunderstands me to be his owner (Nikhil) making a prank call. Finally upon clarification he agrees to have the order delivered in 15 mins. 1610 hrs: Order still undelivered so I again call back. The guy says it will be delivered in 10 mins. 1620 hrs: I get a call asking if I had ordered full or half. 1628 hrs: I get a call stating they have run out of egg biryani and that the order is cancelled.|negative
Rated Food is Good. Service is horrible. Waiters work as if they are serving their term. You are scared of ordering anything in the menu, as the response might be a blunt rejection or an expression which can be read as " How can you be so stupid to order this?". We keep going there because its 2 minutes from where I live, and the food is good!|negative
Rated Not good experience. Delivery issues. Hair in food. Eggzotic food was bland and unenjoyable. Berry smoothie should have been thicker. Penned pasta lacked texture. Waste of money. Packing was good.|negative
Rated Very bad service.. order placed an hr ago and no not yet delivered.. no one takes the call.. bunch of liers.. NEVER ORDER FROM HERE . In store service is worse|negative
Rated There is only one thing worse than bad food at an eatery, and that is rude service. Tried ordering for the first time from this joint. Forty minutes later, the order is nowhere to be seen. I call back and ask the status of this. The person (who sounded uninterested even while taking the order) questioned me quite curtly that it was not even half an hour since I had ordered. Needless to say, that pissed me off and I asked him to cancel the order. No review about the food since it never reached us.|negative
Rated Horrible hygiene. Icecream delivered had a fly in it. Not expected from Baskin Robbins.|negative
Rated So I absolutely love rock music. The other day I decided to satisfy my rock music cravings at Mecca of rock, HRC! And boy, it was very disappointing. I can understand how today people have moved on to EDM, House, Trap music but that does not mean HRC starts playing Gangnam style and Avicii. Reasons why I may never go back here: 1. There were 5 year old kids running around with their maids chasing them.. seriously! Who gets their kids to a place with blaring music and drunk people everywhere! 2. The music. Even when they started playing rock, no heavy metal allowed. Only mainstream rock 3. I never expected HRC to be dead on a saturday night. Compared to the lower parel one which is always full, this one was disappointing. 4. Alcohol is shit expensive and that too for no real reason. I don't see why they are so expensive compared to the other joints in the same area. HRC, lower your prices and stop the kids and crappy music and you might just be back in business.|negative
Rated my experience in tight was not good at all,The management is rude, we called them yesterday 5pm for reservation, they told to us to come their and get a table directly in spite of telling them that we are 5 stags they told to come their, when we reached the venue we came to know that yesterday was ladies night, and no stags are allowed the other guy told to call someone, i called that guy he simply rejected and cut the call, in front of us there were many stags who were going inside, nobody was their to hold them i request every one not to go this club if the owner of this club is reading this message, please change your management. Thank you|negative
Rated I had heard about this place much more times than expected so landed here on a Friday. First of all the staff is really worst, they will not ask whether you have finished eating or not, they will just take the dish away if they see there is little bit remaining in the platter.. I guess they eat the same after taking it. They charge you entry fee Rs. 50 ...for what? For this kind of service?... The food menu is so boring and so does the food..nothing much to offer on that front! There are no imported beers....all you get is domestic ones and bira... And the worst part is the crowd...if you wanna see some cheapsters then this is the place for you. Guys do check out service of TGIF, Jugheads, Poptates etc..you are not even 1% of it.|negative
Rated I found the food and place to be good. However the service needs a lot of improvement. The waiters (if you find one) seem to be disinterested in taking the orders. Ice tea was horrible. We ordered 2 ice teas and had to throw both. That's how terrible it was. I don't remember the other dishes we ordered otherwise I would have reviewed it briefly. Overall, average place to visit! Hope BSE BANDRA lives upto its expectations.|negative
Rated This place is located on the rooftop in the midst of the buzz of Linking Road.this is a decent place to chill out with friends .... we oredered sloppy joe burger, chicken quesadilla and aglio olio pasta with red sangria or a strawberry martini.Cheers! and drinks rate is too cheap!!!!! and service also good..|negative
Rated Well this is no way different than rude. Same menu same drinks.everything same. Except the name. No complaints with rumours either. If u are a rude fan, then u r automatically a rumour fan. A nice place to chill out on A weekend.|negative
Rated #hype is the only word to describe this lounge! Last night i visited the place, being a working day it was totally empty. So we started of with some starters n i had ordered a chocotini, and drinks for my other friends. So in starters we had ordered Crispy American Corn, Nachos with Spicy Salsa and Cheese, Crispy Chilly Garlic Potatoes and a Cheese Garlic Bread. Okay so the only good thing i found here was Chocotini! All the starters were the worst i have ever tasted, specially the American Crispy Corn it was not cooked properly we could literally taste the uncooked flour! Then the worst Nachos i have ever tasted and i tell you the Gujarati khakra will be the better winner here, they were so thick and not at all Mexican. The Crispy Chilly Garlic Potatoes were not at all crispy but taste was good when compared to all the other dishes. We were so disappointed that we had end our meal there.|negative
Rated Its the most pathetic place. The waiters do not bother to take order, the food is bad to taste, the music is too damn loud. Its so loud that the tables and chair are vibrating all the time with the music. The DJ will play heavy bass music to irritate more. The worst of all is the accounts department. When i got the bill everything was double (1st i get a bill of 5400, the actual bill was for 3100). After correction they don't even say sorry. Its a shit place white worst food, music and hospitality.|negative
Rated Had high expectations when I recently visited this place and felt like some Chinese. So ordered mixed Singapore noodles and fish I oyester sauce. The order took almost an hour to come on the table and was disappointed that there was no non veg in the noodles and white n bland, tasteless and I tested sauce fish was red in colour.Oyester sauce is deep brown n never red. Was too hungry so didn't complain or return the dishes. But will never visit again. Waste of money n time. Meant for beer drinkers, not for foodies.|negative
Rated I went to this place on a Sunday Afternoon with family and we immediately got in, don't know if we were lucky or speaks about the standard of the place. The food was disappointing and nothing to talk about for the price they charge. The service is horrible & the waiters need training on customer service. Overall a disappointment and very pricy. I would want to avoid this place.|negative
Rated TGIF !!!! My fav place fr Peproni Pizza !! Wel hv been goin to dis place since the outlet in d mall opened and lemme tell u Peproni pizza and the mock tails are just yum!! The ambience is amazing I would give 5/5 for it and also d decor !! Coming to d staff sorry to say my experience has been pathetic a lot of times they r confused can't suggest stuff too late to bring the food on the table very clumsy I must say!! This tym unfortunately the pizza and the starter both dissapointed us!! But at d end it stays my fav. Plc fr my Peproni pizza!!|negative
Rated The one time I went here (and I am not going back), I found bad music, bad (really bad) food and okay alcohol. The crowd was more like you would expect in a pure veg restaurant than in a beer on a weekend.|negative
Rated Here's a little background. I never give negative reviews to a place. I believe in forgiving and forgetting. But this place I tell you, it forced me to do so. Tip number 1- Avoid ordering from here Tip number 2- If you still want dinner from this place, make sure you order in the afternoon or to be on their safer side, in the morning. Tip number 3- don't order anything apart from chef's speciality.. Because I ordered chef specials and it was ridiculous, so I can only imagine how other dishes will be. Thanks for ruining my dinner.|negative
Rated This is a horrible place to have food from. They are arrogant, serve you stale and bad food. I ordered a couple of chicken combos and none of the order came either on time or correct. Some were missing rice or parathas or the gravy itself. It is just a cool name, the place sucks. Avoid at any cost. Cheats of the first order.|negative
Rated Just like all Starbucks cafes, this one is no different as far as the menu goes. I always pick a cold coffee and either of lemon loaf cake or its large sized cookies. They are always yum. But this is one of the noisiest starbucks I ever have been to. We used to have our reader's club get togethers there but it was very difficult to talk so we have moved to a nearby cafe which is quieter. Aren't cafes meant to relax and chat? This is noisy because of patrons of course but also because of its layout and structure. Most of the seats are either near ordering counter or near entrance. I hope they do something about it.|negative
Rated This delivery only restaurant has the same strength and weakness, it's changing menu. This brings freshness. But also leads to inconsistency in quality and taste. I've had a 40:60 good:bad experience. And that means more bad than good. Over time ordered a horrible sponge cake, a decent brownie, a good noodles base dish, horrible fried rice with some hideous sauce. It's almost scary to order sometimes. I've liked their soups, quite cheap on the pocket but they recently upped their prices. Quite a pity|negative
Rated Overrated food! I read the reviews and checked the pictures and it's nothing close to what's written and one sees. My peri peri burger was bland! It seems spices are an unknown entity to them. Lastly, the order was delivered in time. Try at your own risk.|negative
Rated What a waste of an absolute beauty of a location. Rude staff. Pathetic service. And let's not even talk about the music. Highly okayish food. Not worth visiting at all.|negative
Rated My favorite place to hang out or gorge anytime! We've go here atleast once a week and have never been disappointed so far. The staff is very curt and food is delicious. Must haves are Pav bhaji, Biryani, pani puri, fries and dahi batata puri. foodiesofindia.wordpress.com|negative
Rated Was not happy with the quality and taste of the Pizzas ordered. The BBQ Paneer and it was horrible, the BBQ sauce was stale and tasted horrible. The Veg Mexicanna had no mexican taste at all.. The worst of all was the stuffed garlic bread, no stuffing (expected some good vegitable or jalapeños stuffing), no taste of garlic at all, just a loaf of bread with tasteless chewy cheese in it.. No good choices in veg pizzas too... If Sbarro would try their own pizzas they would give a similar review... Very Disappointed!!!!|negative
Rated Ordered Veg Mexicanna, Veg Barbeque Paneer, Pepperoni Pizza and Chicken Mania...All of these pizzas tasted very very bad! The stuffed Garlic bread was the worse!!! it was literally like having "Kadak Pav"!! Really shocked by our experience as I've tried the stuffed pizza at the mall and it was pretty nice. Hope Sbarro takes this feedback constructively and comes up the curve.|negative
Rated Very bad delivery experience it reached in hour and half late and that too they forgot one item and went back and get it....pizza was cold and to my surprise no pieces cut ...just whole pizza just like that........earlier there was Eagle boys pizza they were alot better.....sorry Sbarro doesnt match up to expectations......very disappointed.|negative
Rated I am in such a pathetic mood ....I don't feel like writing this also .....today I went there with family and my granny was keen on going there .....there was no one to take our order(understaffed) ...the fish (pomfret) was stale ..the rice noodles were lumpy .....even those road side Chinese stalls serve better Chinese food (no jokes) .....pathetic experience......|negative
Rated The food was good. The spicy tofu and the Thai green curry were really tasty, even though they were a little spicy. The main trouble was that when ordering, it took them almost 2 hours to deliver. The service was quite frustrating.|negative
Rated The food is mediocre at best. I can echo the same feelings as some other reviewers have left here, that the food is neither chinese and neither indo-chinese. Have been there two times, one for the buffet and another a la carte. Have been disappointed both times. Not only the food was problem but service was slow and unresponsive. One of those times, we were made to sit in a separate section, kind of a small room with one entrance. Well, almost all servers forgot as if you are sitting there.|negative
Rated Firstly, let me start off with mentioning the 20 minute wait outside the restaurant.. which can be overlooked seeing the crowd. But the fact that our order of clay pot rice and chicken malaysian noodles, took more than 50 minutes to be served to us. Was absolutely disappointed with the staff and the snail pace service. Food was average but will not visit this restaurant again unless these matters can be taken care off .|negative
Rated Typical south indian restaurant, average seating a little untidy and a totally empty ac section on a weekday @2000 hrs. We ordered for a cocktail and lime soda as we wanted to sit and catch up for old times sake.Both were not bad. Will visit this joint again to try their pav bhaji.|negative
Rated This place was like my 2nd home in college days. As far food is concern I would rare them 5/5. Reshmi kabab, pagadi kabab, paneer satay, nizami kabab, dil khush kababare among my favourites. At early days they use too serve bamboo biryani in bamboo stem vessel now they don't :( buh taste is still the same :) people who wanna try yummie dishes and not much concerned about ambience shud surely visit|negative
Rated Shockingly disappointing. Went in with a lot of expectation as it is the first of copper chimneys. Our vegetarian soup abe hayat was good but the chicken lacked character. One comment on the table was that it is something you should serve to patients in a hospital. For starters we ordered a veg and a chicken platter. The chicken platter was ok but not one to remember or rave about. The veg platter on the other hand was disappointing. Except for the potato and the mushroom nothing else was worthy of being served at copper chimney, including the paneer which was just humongous cubes marinated. A good sunday evening turned into a disappointment. With - Rinkugrwl5 Swati Tomar 3menwalking.com|negative
Rated Gave 1.5 for the food but have to reduce lot pf points for delivery. The food took 80 minutes to deliver and the food had gone cold. Looked like the food was prepared more than half hour ago. After putting a complaint for the delay, the blame game between Zomato and the restaurant started...|negative
Rated We ordered home delivery and the guy lost the way which ended up we waiting for alot for the food. The food was also a dissapointment. Apart from one starter we didnt like anything much. Bad experience.|negative
Rated Maroosh is locoated right next to Mad Over Donuts at Phoenix and unfortunately has got very few tables and can accommodate just a couple of people. We ordered for the Chicken Reshmi and Chicken Hummus Salad and were disappointed both with the filling and taste.|negative
Rated We were sent here by the other maroosh @ lower parel as their systems were down.. so ended up here.. we had some offer coupons but for somereasons they could not locate the code online.. we had to wait for so long and till then they had made the shawarmas and kept and were not handing it over to us!!! Finally after waiting for so long they located it and gave us the cold shawarmas! ! What is wrong with maroosh!!!!!! Never gonna go back to this place again.. dont keep offers of you cant handle it!!|negative
Rated Light house cafe situated at Worli has all the aesthetics of being a nice place, the décor and set up is good but when it comes down to the food and service this place has a lot to learn. We ordered for nachos, pesto pasta and pizza. The best dish out of them was the nachos, it's served with beans and salsa, there a very little melted cheese which I think it needs a lot more of. The pesto pasta lacked seasoning and needed a lot of additions to taste nice. The pizza was way below average, the sauce was completely flavourless. I would completely avoid the pizzas. We ordered the Chocolate Mud cake for desert and the way it was served was unacceptable, we tried to reason with the waiter to replace the dish but he(chandan) started arguing and defending the way the dish was made. Sorry to say the level of service was deplorable. Nikhil aroras crew really need to pull up there socks...|negative
Rated Subway is one of my favourite chains to grab a quick, healthy lunch from, but this has got to be the worst outlet I've visited in the whole of Bombay. First of all, their lettuce is never fresh. It's always wilted and brown, and often mixed with cabbage (they make it a point to inform you of this, but still). Another time, I bought a chocolate milk from them, and later realised that it had expired MONTHS back. When I went back the next day to tell them this (couldn't go back the same day as I had done a takeaway), they simply shrugged and said they can't help it. Horrible service, and below average in terms of hygiene and quality of food. Give this outlet a miss.|negative
Rated As much as I like Subway, I have to admit this is the worst outlet ever. The AC doesn't work most of the times, waiters are chilling on the mezzanine level, they don't have most of the sauces. And worst of all, they refuse to serve Egg & Bacon sub, even when they have it. Reason: Sir it's only till 11am and also our sales figures go down if we serve it. Bhenchod!! My advice, go next door to that Udipi or have a roadside sandwich.|negative
Rated Seriously pathetic , the subway sandwich they make looks more like a road side sandwich. They hardly put any fillings in it and when you tell them to put more they will make faces at you and say stupid things. Also the promotional offers the company runs they try to force it on people and misguide you. Located at such a prime location , the management should try to improve it.|negative
Rated The mutton biryani was very average in taste and quality. The rice were el dente and the quality of the meat average. They dont send raita coz the yogurt gets sour! The easy fix wud be to send the veggies and yogurt separate and assemble it later. At 1750/kg the price is too steep to make mistakes.|negative
Rated This is a place I've been desperately wanting to go to :) I have read so much about them on Facebook that I'm just waiting for the right time as I dont live in Bombay unfortunately and these guys dont come to Bangalore :(|negative
Rated Amalgamation of Indian and south East Asian food.. Two storied restaurant with tandoori and dim sums served in lower deck.. Upper deck has live sushi and teppanyaki counter.. Tried sushi and dim sums .. Worth giving it a try..|negative
Rated Perusing the web, I see on a fasting website that a diet of "bread and water" forces one to differentiate between what one "wants" and what one "needs". San-Qi's Sunday Brunch forces its guests to reflect on this little nugget of worldly wisdom. I'm not sure how anyone would be desirous of anything beyond the simple confines of bread and water at this woeful attempt at a fine dine breakfast. The bread with apricots and nuts, the warm focaccia and wholemeal sliced bread - the first installment along the dual level buffet procession - lure you into a false sense of security at San-Qi. The bread is delicious. By the time, the businessman, who I dined with, calls for the butter, I was already scouring the buffet in hope of finer things. On the first floor, everything has a rather ghastly and generic "pan-Asian" air about it. A few notable abominations include spinach noodles in green tea and "soupy gloup" (the sweetcorn soup) which was like nose diving into a pit of quick sand. The samosas were the only hint of Indian cuisine I could find on either floor and were passable although excruciatingly dry, as they had been left sitting under the lights since the start of service I imagine. More Asian dishes, which are brought to the table, are found lurking at the end of the first level counter. We collectively called for the salt and pepper potatoes and some more spinach noodles (this time minus the green tea). Sadly, these dishes took over 30 minutes to arrive and only after mentioning this several times to various different waitresses. This included the rather haughty but well spoken manager, who also proposed in a pitiful gesture of consolation if I would like some stir fried vegetables as well, which again arrived another eternity later after the other dishes. In the interim, I found refuge in a bowl of penne with tomato sauce ( I didn't realise pasta was now a pan-Asian speciality). I was comforted to see the packets of De Cecco on full display, but slightly irked by the rather oleaginous sauce. I can appreciate a rather lavish drizzle of olive oil when plating the pasta, but not to cook the sauce in pools of it. The dessert counter bestows more atrocities on the obstreperous guests to be found in the Four Seasons. The puff pastry square with a raspberry topping is heavy and tasteless, despite being fervently pitched to me by the pastry chef as a "must try". The Chocolate Soufflé, found in a self contained corner of the restaurant was without a doubt the most heinous and abhorrent dessert I have ever witnessed. I had seen the Soufflé ramekins lying around on the counter and had specifically checked with the man operating the dessert oven, like a railway boy firing a steam train, whether a decent Soufflé was even a remote possibility. "Yes Sir, Yes Sir" was the reply. The Soufflé arrived at the table, completely sunk, heavy and burnt. At this stage, I must point out the obstreperous nature of the guests, who are found on the large table besides us. In curt imperative-filled sentences, these guests order waiters around like servants of a by-gone age from their burnished thrones of social sanctimony. Much to my dismay, I see they are served on time without similar mishaps of our own service. It seems such a travesty, that meekness really isn't majesty when it comes to serving guests at San-Qi. However it seems many establishments have forgotten that restaurant criticism is still the meek man's parade of justice and remains one of the best ways of bringing such culinary chicanery to light. AA Connoisseur|negative
Rated San Qi I don't know how this place gets reservations cause even calling from dubai they do not wish to answer the phone and put me on hold twice and the call got disconnected it's a shame to be a five star and not have the etiquette to answer a call ...|negative
Rated Ambience is very average. Small cockroaches running around d place. Fry surmai was the only thing worth eating. Rest of d food below average. Fry Bombay ducks were spoilt so had to I e it back. Rice was undercooked or stale hence too hard to eat. Shall not visit again.|negative
Rated 215 bucks for a chicken meal and actually i got next to nothing. The quantity is ridiculous. Except chicken gravy which hardly had 1 or 2 tiny pieces nothing is worth mentioning. The delivery was pathetic, especially when you claim 40 mins and you only deliver then you cant afford to be late by 20 to 25 mins, sorry for being rude but you cant because that should be your forte. Well i highly doubt i am going to order from here again, sorry guys definitely needs lots of improvement.|negative
Rated Not considering the not so lame it is situated in while writing this review... But still the food taste... Was not good. The bean dip was alright... But the nachos were not good. The worst was the beetroot carpaccio... The taste, the flavour, the bite... All not in place. The service too sucked. Not a place I would go again.|negative
Rated There is nothing new about reviewing a Domino's Pizza. It is same across locations. I am taking the pain of writing this review because of two issues:- one, they are very inefficient in taking orders. You have to repeat everything two-three times and still there are chances that they would take down wrong orders. Two, they sometimes do not accept credit card (saying the swiping machine is not working), and if you give cash they say change is not there and they will come back with changes, and then came back with less amount of changes. This thing happened twice to me. I don't know whether it is intentional or not, but twice the same mistake in exactly similar manner raised my suspicion.|negative
Rated good quality food at cheap rate. Service is the only annoying thing at this place , bit late. 4/5 for the ambience and 2/5 for the service..|negative
Rated Had a quick lunch today at the Coffee Shop at the St. Regis, known as Seven Kitchens. We started off with an assortment of cold salads, seafood, cold cuts & sushi all of which were quite good. Especially the broccoli & salami Milano in a mustard dressing & the heart of palms with sundried tomatoes. Unfortunately that is where the pleasant part of out meal ended. For the mains I started with the salt less Asian fried lamb. They had some divine looking pork chops but unfortunately there was no meat and just fat on the bone. I was then told by the waiter to try their mutton biryani which consisted of fragrant rice and dry and chewy pieces of mutton . The kulcha's we ordered unfortunately never showed up to the table. Lastly for dessert I would only recommend the waffles which were crisp and light. Served with a side of vanilla ice cream and berry compote. The creme brûlée did not have the signature crispy bruleed sugar top it is supposed to have. Overall it was a very poor meal definitely not something I would expect from the St. Regis group.|negative
Rated Have been here a couple of times. Located inside a furniture store in raghuvsnshi mill compound. The place is kinda hidden gem. The menu is limited but you can assured of quality and must mention which will put number of fine dining places to shame. Their thin crust pizza, tomato basil soups, quesedials, Apple pie are must have. The reason for not giving it a higher rating is two fold- lack of valet parking and limited staff which results in delayed orders in case the place is crowded. Lastly the joint closes early at around 10pm so ensure to plan your relax meal accordingly.|negative
Rated Visited this restaurant after 3-4years and was totally disappointing. We didnt wanted to go far so we choose this over many options. Two of them were running late, so me and my other friend ordered for a garlic cheese bread, tomato basil soup and blue lagoon ;). Start was good. Everything was well seasoned and sensible. After that stuff started becoming weird. Chrispy paneer was pathetic. Just the covering tasted good. Chicken 65 as tangy as tamarind. And one more something chicken wantons there was hardly any chicken in it. Next we were excited for sizzlers and ordered for assorted ones with spaghetti, paneer skewers and white cheese sauce. Damn! Was the most pathetic decision ever. They were totally unexpected. And mogitos were okay and blue lagoon was also good. Food was little disappointing.|negative
Rated Very disappointed. Ordered the khepsa biriyani, mutton sheekh kebab etc for approx 2400/-. After 2.5hrs of ordering no delivery was made...... Several attempts to call were ignored and the phones were not answered. Cannot be trusted to deliver|negative
Rated Below expectations.. Had been to these place with high on expectations but they let me down.. Food was OK.. But the restaurant is overpriced.. Service is on but waiter kept on prompting have these and that which pissed me off|negative
Rated Worst taste... I have ordered tisrya suka ... It's completely mood off when I had tested it... So much improvement is required.... Tisrya suka is full of shells only... I can give... 0 stars for this hotel...|negative
Rated Worst restaurant I have ever visited. Went there recently with my friends for birthday celebration. We ordered 6 thalis and we got r dish after 1 hr 30 min. We asked for kombdi wade we got chapatis. N after 1st we asked for roti we got kombdi wade. pathetic staff and poor service standard. Better to visit local dhaba. value for money is 0. . .highly not recommended.|negative
Rated Pricing strategy is veryy poor...they dnt knw to price the dishes...highly priced!!! Food quality is good bt need to concntrate on their pricing of the foods...if they focus on the prices then there will b more footfalls in the resto|negative
Rated One Sunday we happened to order the food from here....falling for the false misleading advertisements obviously we thought they really do amazing sushi but NO they don't. Having ordered the sushi's, wok and the dim sums(which turned out decent) I think this place needs to improve on the sushi (veg) and the woks. Wok as a sign isn't very tricky or difficult to make. It's barely assembling and blending the tight ingredients to make it taste good. Firstly Wok Express is the only place that limits you from crossing the ingredient for eg only 6 veggies, only one sauce like what ? Really What if I want more or maybe I like to combine 2 flavours.. The guy who took my order said no :/. Secondly the wok tested bad and hated the flavour I was suggested. The Sushi was pathetic to next level and the entire food costs me a grand (INR 1000) I think Loco Chino doesn't a better job for a reasonable price. Guys please make sure you don't fall for any misleading or false marketing done by these guys and I really hope they improve with time :)|negative
Rated I was left disappointed after my first visit here. I was told that they were out of mutton and wings for the night and everything had to be substituted with chicken. The burgers were good but the chicken wings served as a side to the burger was bland and tasteless. I hope to have a better outing the next time.|negative
Rated Unfortunately, you cant rate half or zero because thats how baaaaaad the mexicano burger was. Whats good about this place is its super cheap other than that its a shabby little place & I wonder why anyone would eat here when vileparle offers such great vegetarian options. We also tried dakshin fries. They were ok. 2.5/5 for the fries. Burger literally 0/5. The electric wiring where the customers eat is dangerously exposed and unsafe. NEVER going back. I generally don't like to be super mean in a review but the burger just sucked that bad.|negative
Rated Ordered Pronz there, which didnt taste good at all. It was bad experience it tasted bit soggy too. I hope these guys will look into this matter.|negative
Rated Horrible..is the word... Stale veggies Subway has lost its standard... I dunno y Quiznos din work wich was top notch Only a few selected ones like d one at Phoenix n Bandra have d quality rest all are below average I wudnt be surprised to find worms in d lettuce 😖😖😖😖|negative
Rated I wish i could rate it much low..lets begin with the entire story..to start with, we reachd at this place arnd 3.30 and we asked the waiter that is north indian available or not? He said it is bt provided v give our entire order on d spot..v gave our entire order together..the waiters there were so rude that he actually took away the plate in which i was having my soup just to make place for roti's which he bought together having no bloody sense abt the way food should be served..he got a very different vegetable than the ordered one..later when one of our family member spoke to him he told a lady to shut up n have food quietly..hopeless exp..STRICTLY NOT RECOMMENDED|negative
Rated Most pathetic Chinese food I have eaten in a long time. Chicken coriander soup - only chicken stock with some coriander leaves. Chicken pepper - no good And last but not the least Prawns Thai curry - nowhere near any Thai or curry.|negative
Rated So first thing first. This place is overly hyped. Tried almost all their specialties and to my shock nothing was good let alone great. The missal for which it gained popularity recently was the worst I have had till date. Can Surely give it a miss !|negative
Rated I went to this outlet today but the price is too high for this area if they decrease the price n keep nominal then this outlet. Can do good business because this area is the place where lower cast stay so see if you can then do or else sorry this outlet will close down|negative
Rated It maybe a bad choice to order Thai food from this Chinese joint; I realised that. I ordered for a home delivery of the Thai Red Chicken Curry with Steamed rice and Chicken Lollypops. Considering it's Thai food the order took a good amount of time for delivery. BUT.. The Thai curry tasted horrific. It seemed to have been cooked in coconut oil with some schezwan sauce and it was watery! Imagine having that with Steamed rice. The chicken Lollypops were like any of the other Chinese joints. May not order again from this place.|negative
Rated Home delivery took a long time than committed. Food not that great.. There are better Chinese restaurants in the vicinity. Had ordered chicken chilli dry, veg schezwan noodles, Chicken triple schezwan rice and manchow soup. Except the soup, everything else was bland.|negative
Rated Worst place I ever seen. No quality, no good service, in fact employee as well as owner don't have manners. Wasted my money. unhygienic food. I wanted to give rating in minus but it won't allow, that's y given 1.|negative
Rated Maharashtrian style food. Very expensive. Less quantity, more charges, not so worth for the taste. I visit here with my family most of the time. Hidden somewhere inside the lane|negative
Rated What on earth are they feeding in the name of Mexican food. Authenticity was nowhere close in the store. The stupidest burritos i had tasted in my life. Upon that exaggerating prices they put up on menu. One rating is only due to some dip they had which was tasting superb. Couldn't care much to ask what is it as i was literally taken down by the main food. Run if u see them.|negative
Rated Poor food quality, I would suggest do not visit this place as there much better options around. Place is clean, but service is poor. Not at all value to money.|negative
Rated Shit food,who had thought that this restaurant will be legend like mahesh and pratap .Going there first time was a bit excited but when ate the khichia papad ,SHIT|negative
Rated Nothing extraordinary about this place. The garlic bread sucked big time! It was just Plain bread toast and very hard at the sides. Even other dishes didn't look that nice|negative
Rated THE WORST HOTEL WE EVER HAD, THE PERSON ON PHONE DONT LISTEN TO WHAT HAS BEEN ORDERED RATHER IS EAGER TO DISCONNECT THE PHONE... WORST EVER EXPERIENCE.... WHY DO ZOMATO DOES NOT HAVE - RATINGS NOT WORTH 1 .0 ALSO...|negative
Rated Dont go for this place ...specially for late night ...get closed at 12.30....waiter comes to u n tell u loudly...jaldi karo band honewala hai.....arrogant staff|negative
Rated was one of my favourite restaurants once upon a time but the food quality has now gone down a big time!! ordered a paneer starter and the paneer tasted stale! I thought post renovation, the quality must have improved but thats not the case.|negative
Rated An average restaurant with some new chic ambience. We ordered Thai mushroom babycorn cottage cheese soup which was a fantastic start. The main course paneer amritsari was average and methi mutter malai was below average. Parathas were good but ridiculously small. Even chapatis at my home are bigger in size. The 3/5 rating above is coz of soup and (the quality) of parathas. Waiters were in a hurry since it was a Sunday. Slightly overpriced. Can be given a miss if you have other options.|negative
Rated My bad i didnt listen to all the reviews about it. Totally over priced!. The food is below average. Buffet didn't have much variety and way to costly. Service is slow and not very cheerful. U have better places to go. So it is a no no!|negative
Rated Really horrid. Only ordered garcia's ages ago years and years when it first opened it really wasn't that bad. Now?! Tough base, odd tasting cheese, tomato sauce is really sweet and the price for the quality is ridiculous. Avoid. Go for crave or tertullia instead, prices are reasonable and quality is much better|negative
Rated Unfortunately i am rating you guys down for the Horrible Experience for the Food that got delivered yesterday.. "Greenz" - After turning to Salads and searching the net for a Proper Salad Corner near my office I found this place which looked worth. It has been nearly 4 times i have ordered from their Outlet. When it Comes to Delivery - No Doubt they are perfect on time. They might say 1hr But within 30 min approx. I have got it delivered at my workplace. Packaging: Fantastic. Till now i never had any issue regarding the way you guys send across the Salad Box. Actually to say you can reuse those boxes. Food: Till Now I have tasted nearly 5 Salad Boxes. Chicken Haystack Salad Health Freak Veggie Popular Chicken Hay Stack Salad Chicken Pasta Salad Lean Chicken Oriental Salad Except the Last everything Taste amazing.. I would say Exotic Veggies that is placed well and taste superb... Unfortunately, the last meal was not so good. I would say worst. I have already ordered 4 times from this place and every time iI have received the best-packed Salad. But unfortunately, my last order would term it as "Disaster". I am not sure whether the person who packed the salad was in so much hurry that he forgot to place it properly. When it comes to food I hate to compromise. If someone disappoints me I surely would not order back. Normally I get the Salad at one side of the box with Chicken placed on the other side. But this one meal was not worth. It was shabby, tasteless and messed up. The veggies were not at all fresh nor anywhere meeting the standards of being Oriental Veggies.. Nor was the chicken fresh and edible. It is important to stick to what you really show on the Images. I hope you don't disappoint again.|negative
Rated Food here is below average.. Had lot of expectations on fish cutlet and biryani. Thought they ll bring out the authentic Bengali feel. But they failed to do so. Request the management for a overhaul|negative
Rated A not so great rolls place for a one that calls itself "rolls & company". Highly overpriced, especially given that it's just a thela with a roof and walls. Probably most frequented by the hungry office-crowd around, though I see more of a rush at the vada pav stall just outside (which I do recommend btw). My first visit there was also my last.|negative
Rated This place is the WORST place to have anything! There is not much choice in the cakes they offer nor do they have good pastries! The cheese on the veg pizza is just so bad that I don't want to describe it. The non veg pizza's chicken has to be chewed a lot and the vegetables don't taste fresh at all! I really want all my viewers to beware of these mini land mines which are spread all across the city :P Make a wise decision ;)|negative
Rated Ab wo maza nai raha Monginis me. Taste, quality and flavours have fallen to a great level. Kya Hua Mongini waalo, bas rate badhaate raho aur quality ghataate raho...|negative
Rated Not worth it ! Bad quality only quantity If u need quantity go for it|negative
Rated The food is not good. The pizza was burnt, the paneer appetizer was bland, nachos were soggy. The service was slow. I did not really like the experience.|negative
Rated This place deserves a rating below than 1 1. Manager doesn't know how to behave and talk to the customers over the phone or even personally..He thinks he is the boss who owns this place.. 2.We were informed about the buffet and the moment we reached,they said the option is not available. 3.*Complete waste of time*.The moment we the called the manager over the phone to rectify the mistake and were expecting an apology,but in return he was showing us his pathetic attitude,and blaming us instead for reaching there late.. 4.Such behaviour is a curse for such a lovely place..I am not coming here again definitely and would even not recommend people to come here.. 5.Thank you guys for wasting our precious time..|negative
Rated Second time visiting and must say that the quality has gone down. Ordered the karaage chicken which is nothing but a thin strip of chicken covered in tempura batter 3 times its size and soaking in oil. Also ordered the lamb steak sizzler. Surprisingly they do not serve a lamb steak as the name suggests. It's basically rice with lamb gravy. To add to the dish wasn't even sizzling. Sent it back.|negative
Rated Nothing great. An overhyped restaurant. Single meal bowls are bland. The starters are just average and nothing spectacular. Definitely a pricey place. It's small and there's always a queue during peak times!|negative
Rated A nothing place. Is it a bar, is it a lounge, is it a diner, is it a cafe ? ... its something in between ... drinks ... just ok ... starters ... just ok ... service ... just ok ... music ... just ok ... in this world of Bombay Canteen ... this place needs some catching up.|negative
Rated The ambiance is disappointing but the food is alright. However it is over priced. The food isn't exquisitely delicious and the menu is misleading. One of the worst experiences of my life. The service was also very bad.|negative
Rated Asilo badly wantd to visit diz plc...finally landed up...plc n view was ♥_♥ skyline!! Orderd fr frozen lychee mocktail followed by flatbread and barbequed cottage cheese!! Food+ambience+service=thumsup!! Must definitely try out diz plc!!|negative
Rated I don't think I've had tea that could be this bad. Decided to order it via swiggy. It took longer than usual but didn't matter as I was in no hurry. Decided to go for the kesar chai. The packaging looked good and the kulhads were intact. They truly love up to the saying of looks can be deceptive. The box refused to open without leaking out the tea all over my work table and the taste ! So so bad ! The tea didn't seem to have any milk in it. It was watery and I think they forgot to put the kesar in it. Frankly the taste of kesar can be smelt from miles away ! They really need to improve on their quality and with their exorbitant prices it can't get any worse ! I do hope they serve better tea in their outlet. Cause I don't think I'll order from here ever again.|negative
Rated I knew Bombay Blue wasn't very good but I didn't expect it to be this bad either. We ordered Nachos and the three sauce pasta. Nachos were pretty okay,nothing special about them. The pasta was terrible, all the three sauces were badly cooked. I wouldn't suggest it to anyone else.|negative
Rated A good place to bring to have lunch with your family, but even though the place opens at 12pm one must either come before 1pm or make a reservation else may have to wait for a table. I took my parents here for a pending anniversary present and thought the food was disappointing. We ordered the veg platter, channa bhatora and pav bhaji. Although the food had flavor it was too oily and left an uneasy feeling in the stomach throughout the afternoon.|negative
Rated This place has a wide range of dishes on the menu. The food though was not as expected. We reluctantly scraped through the plate. Fell ill the next day with a upset stomach. Never visit|negative
Rated Getting a table here is so difficult in peak hours since it's too tiny. They serve truly authentic Chinese food here. It's bang opposite to phenoix mall. Service is quick & taste is fab ! Ordered Crab soup Plum corn crispy Chicken burnt chilly rice Blueberry cheesecake Choco cake|negative
Rated Very disappointed. Firstly, they took a surprisingly long time to deliver. Once they did...only the veg sandwich was labeled, which was a little redundant cos the veg and non veg sandwiches have different coloured packaging. The veg and non veg sandwiches were also in the same packet, rather than in different ones. We had ordered 4 sandwiches, with which they sent just 3 tissues. And the sandwiches were surprisingly small, for the price. They also got the order wrong - right from the bread, to putting onions in it. Overall quite dissatisfied. Doubt I'll order from here again.|negative
Rated It's a small outlet, almost blink and miss! We ordered the tomato basil lasagna, the Penne Alfredo, Mac and cheese pizza and the Spaghetti Aglio E Olio. As accompaniment, we ordered iced tea and an Oreo shake along with a strawberry banana shake. The iced tea was decent, but the Oreo shake was a little too much milk and less Oreo. Besides that, the food was good. The penne Alfredo was lip smacking and easily my favourite! The Mac n cheese pizza was great too! All in all, the place is worth the food and not overpriced. The lack of seating and space might be a problem, but it is definitely worth it!|negative
Rated Practically all the other restaurants were full on a Saturday Night in Palladium Mall, happened to try out Asia Kitchen."Indian Chinese" food tends to taste the same no matter what resturant you visit. Only here for the cocktails, few starters & it wasn't a bad experience at all . The Dim Sum platter ( 9 pieces ) was the biggest let down. All the dim sums were tasting the same, since all were chicken. + it seemed it wasn't really prepared, it tasted more or less that the cold storage product. 2/5 The Mongolian Skewered Lamb was really awesome. Everything about the dish from the theater effect to the taste. It was really tender and the Chinese flavours blended in together. 5/5|negative
Rated Been here yesterday for Dinner.. Was not very crowded, table for 4 was easily available but for 6 + it was little difficult to get eight away. We waited for sometime and got the table for 8 with little adjustment of chairs. The waiter asked me which water to be served,I said regular water and then he said ohh muncipalti water..I was like hell don't you have etiquettes to talk... Then ordered couple of started chatpata shakarkand, cheese papadi shots and harabhara kabab..which were jus OK in taste..cheese papadi shots was waste of time and money...then in main course ordered phinadari kofta vegetable..which was too spicy.. Amritsar papad are just too spicy made up of Kali Mirchi.. Dnt waste money in papad.. The vegetable was so spicy tht nobody preferred second roti/naaan.. Just to see hv we made wrong choice, tght of ordering alloo paratha to see how does tht basic thng taste like..but won't Blv tht was also too spicy and not good in taste.. So with all these ordered we made conclusion tht thr is no point wasting our money here by keep ordering.. Since this restaurant is new its running as of now..m sure after couple of months with this taste it can't survive... Would not recommend this resto...|negative
Rated This place highly disappointment since I had a delightful meal at Persia Darbar in Jogeshwari. I am still unsure if they are related since I get mixed feedback/confirmation. Our office had a team lunch and biryani seemed like the logical and preferred choice for a bunch of 27 odd folks. I recommended Persian Darbar after speaking to them about quantity and logistics. We placed an order 2 days in advance for 2kgs Veg Biryani, 2kgs Chicken Biryani, 1 single serving Egg biryani and 1 kg Mutton Biryani. Sure enough on D-day the order arrived albeit slightly late - that I can totally forgive given Andheri East traffic and our location. The orders (except for Egg biryani) came in large Biryani couldrons/Vessels which we were to return to them after. The presentation was fantastic, there were layers and significant amount of vegetables and meat in all except mutton. The flavor was good but the main problem was the oil used. Everyobne complained about the vegetarian biryani being sticky and greasy like it was cooked in bad oil or dalda. The chicken biryani was also greasy but people didn't seem to mind and made peace with it. The egg and mutton biryanis seemed to be the best. However, the vegetarians in our team were disappointed and sadly alot of it was wasted as they were unable to eat beyond a single serving. Quantity was absolutely not an issue and there were generous portions for all. BIG drawback was no raita or sides with the biryani. I would expect that with such a large order, raita and kachumber (salad) should be a must like many establishments do. They simply told us to place a separate order which we declined to do so. So I would count that as a minus. I am not ready to write of this place since I was the mutton/chicken biryani hogger. However, bad oil/dalda used is a big NO NO for me especially for an establishment known for its signature cuisine. Persian Darbar please take note.|negative
Rated UCC is a small canteen like chinese joint on marol maroshi road. Although the ambience din feel so great..the food made up for it. Decided to try the veg wanton fry in the starters and veg hong kong noodles in main course; the first particularly being very crispy and very good. The wanton fry is basicaly a dumpling version of spring rolls deep fried. The hong kong noodles was nothing exceptional,yet well made. Overall,this place is not a bad option if your looking for chinese options near marol.|negative
Rated Won't be too critical while reviewing since I haven't visited this place but got an opportunity to order in once.. Ordered a chicken biryani and it wasnt all that great.. Sadly it is one of those biryanis which are cooked on demand when an order comes in and thus very similar to a fried rice.. Though the taste was good but it wasnt a biryani for sure. No comments about the ambience since I ordered in. Would update this once I visit the place and try their shawarmas.|negative
Rated Really bad!!!! This was the first time we were trying this food chain. Went there for dinner. Located at sakinaka on really busy road. No parking available and no valet either. We tried chicken shawarma, falafel with humus, Moroccan kebab, nizami biryani. All the dishes was pathetic. The guy who was serving us was really weird didn't understood was he was upto. We were the only people sitting in that restaurant which itself described where this restaurant stands. My friend really uncomfortable being a girl. Waiters were acting really weird.|negative
Rated Minks saoji, had heard a lot about it. Went there with curiosity. Carved for Nagpur's saoji taste. We ordered saoji chicken and mutton kheema. Mutton kheema was somehow OK. Chicken soaji was near to saoji in Nagpur. Just in terms of color, presentation etc. In taste its too far. Jeera garlic rice was also not done properly. Specially the garlic was not fried fully. On the other side, its too costly. It's almost double the price. It takes the rating scale down. I wish the taste side was more heavy. :p|negative
Rated We had very bad experience ordering food from this outlet... The order was supposed to reach within 1 hour.. But instead took around 1 hour 45 mins .. The subs were all tacky and smuged by the time they reached..!!! Rinkle Shah|negative
Rated The worst subway ever experienced. I request people to please stay away from this outlet at any cost. Ordered for home delivery and received the same almost after 1 and a half hour and that too were so ungrateful in accepting their mistake|negative
Rated The BIGGEST mistake a restaurant can make is to send NON-VEG food to a customer who has ordered veg food. It has happened to me for the first time in my 25 years and I am emotionally hurt. I ordered Veg Haka Noodles with Manchurian on March 16 (photo attached). Gobblr sent me non veg Manchurian instead. I realized it after i took a bite. Photos are attached here for a proof. My previous experience was also not good with this restaurant. Only thing i want to say everyone - "GO TO SEARCH BOX above and find a different restaurant because these guys just don't get it" Veg People - STRICT NO NO Non-Veg People - SERVICE IS NOT GOOD ANYWAY|negative
Rated It was a rude shock to see the place serving food in such a mess. Can see oil stains from previous customers who dined on tables. The decor was perfect for one day but then I don't know what the management decided and it for twisted totally. Should consider shutting this place down. Heard rat noises from kitchen while I was dining and immediately decided to never step in again. The cook and waiters are loud. And not to mention, a server keeps staring and is irritated when asked for things. This WAS going to be my and my friends to- go place when I saw the decor was being done nicely, wonder what got that stopped. Wish it were nicely done. Should seriously consider having your place at all because my office colleagues along with me at many times have found it unhygienic. Advice to the management that you should or shouldn't change decor of a place, not screw it up like this. The bar counter is beautiful. Whoever did that should be brought and rest should be changed too. Or else mustea will lose customers!|negative
Rated Ordered Breakfast from this Joint on a Lazy Sunday Ordered a pot of Adraki Chai, Tawa Chilly Idli, Gobi & Aloo Paratha, Poha and Kheema Pav. The food was decent. The chai was good. The Kheema Pav sucked. Parathas were damn good.|negative
Rated Ordered for a non veg noodle soup which was described as a clear soup with noodles, pak choy mushroom, carrot and zucchini - and some honey tossed crispy noodles. The home delivery took much longer than expected and the food tasted quite horrible. The crispy noodles was pathetic, smelled of bad oil and the soup had only some noodles, chicken and cabbage floating in the broth - no sign of vegetables whatsoever. Apart from the quantity of food - there was literally nothing that worked for me - zero flavour, quality and consistency issues. All in all, would never re-order from this place again.|negative
Rated Ordered for a house party. Tom yum soup, thai lounge potato, chilli basil prawns, red thai curry, and a couple of woks in hunan sauce and black pepper sauce. Order took almost 1 hr 15 minutes to reach. Cold by then. And Panda, i hate cold food. Had to reheat in a microwave. Packaging just about OK. Tom yum – The distinctive kaffir lime taste was missing. But soup was spicy. So ok. Thai lounge potatos – cold starters not easy to revive. No comments. Chilli basil prawns – prawn size medium. Nice flavour of chilli basil (one of my favourites) Red thai curry – safest thai dish to order. Difficult for any chef to mess up. Ok taste. Could have been a little more thicker. Woks – Hunan sauce bad, black pepper sauce good. flat noodles sad (poor quality) Difficult to recommend, when you have better home ordering options in the region like Tao9, Pan of Asia, and Mainland China.|negative
Rated It was the day after Christmas and me and my friends were watching a movie and we're all lazy to move out of the house to grab a bite! So we decided to try square pizza. The banner fascinated most of us and the pizza's delivered were up to the mark! A serious competitor in the pizza company!|negative
Rated Was totally disappointed with the quality of the pizzas. Not at all up to the mark. The only plus point was the cheese as we had ordered cheeseburst pizzas.|negative
Rated The place place is meant for regular people from offices around. This is good hangout place for near by offices no doubt. The service is useless where as food quality is questionable. Taste 4 Ambience. 6 Service. 2 Value for money 2 Overall 4|negative
Rated Terrible experience; arrogant, unprofessional, and rude staff; order was delayed by an hour; not recommended either for dining or foe delivery.|negative
Rated Food - ZERO Ambiance - 1 Service - NEGATIVE Value For Money - 900 For 2. Though the name may appeal as another quality food chain, but would advice to give it a skip and prefer any street food. Absolutely pathetic food standards and hygiene. Had no option or else would have rated negative. FOOD - Almost everything, burger or bagel might have multiple bread options viz. regular, brown, multi grain, etc. But just when you are astonished by the varieties on offer from such a small outlet, issues knock in. Barbeque Chicken Bagel had hard chicken pieces. Sausage, Egg & Mushroom Bagel was nothing but an experience of tasting another substandard bagel. Disappointed post our initial order, we thought of trying out pizzas. But much to our surprise, the pizzas served had burnt crust. And adding to it, we were served with metallic wire from the kitchen utensils dish-washer on the crust which was an absolute neglegance. Though they charge you extra for cheese the quantity doesn't justify the cost. Cheese Garlic Bread too was disappointing since cheese used was just average. LET DOWN - Barbeque Chicken Bagel, Sausage, Egg & Mushroom Bagel, Chicken Supreme Pizza, Veg Supreme Pizza, Cheese Garlic Bread. AMBIANCE - Too small a place. Sitting arrangements arn't great either and cramps you up if you are walking in with a mid sized group. SERVICE - Another aspect which needs great lift. Server cum Chefs are unaware about the term "hygiene". You might come across watching them scratch their head, dig their noses and all such unwanted scenes. Would advice them to use disposable gloves at least while preparing dishes. Overall there exist management disaster.|negative
Rated Samvene Bagel Cafe lies beneath the metro station in the madness of Marol. I had been to another SBC outlet in versova which shut many years ago. The 1 thing I found common in both was that they both loved to put excessive amounts of Mustard Mayo in their bagels and burger. And this one also had too many flies inside the cafe. Despite the AC being on. So not a great experience. If you ignore their Mayo problem, they can be really good.|negative
Rated have nothing much to say but had gone to had lunch over there, found a dead mosquito near my plate, since they've got a cooking counter near the main road. its not hygienic at all!|negative
Rated It isn't easy to find out this place tucked in a small corner of a little unknown mall. But who am i to comment, when i am still figuring the Mall and Commercial complex diffrence and the standards which differentiate both. So the moment you would enter the place. The first thing which will hit you is the space. The place is huge from Mumbai Standards Coming to the ambiance, It had dim light being full crowded it was a bit noisy too, the music was a bit loud but playing bollywood numbers and Coke Studio. Coming to the core, Food. This place is an Oasis in Dessert for North Indian Fodd lovers. The Dal Makhni, Kadahi Paneer. I went with friends recommendations. The Place is Run by Sikh Gentleman and he has done justice to the place. We Delhites drool over the site of a Dark Brown thick Gravilicious topped with White Swirls of Cream. The sight and Smell took me to Delhi. The Kadahi Paneer wasnt bad either. It was great from mumbai standard. The only other place i know which serves great Dal Makhni would be Carvan Serai but i had lunch there 5 years back. waiting to check out and reveiw that place again.|negative
Rated I was here for lunch with friends.I use to frequently go to pop Tate's and always thought of eating at urban tadka sometime.And we did.The food was bad.Ordered lemon chicken and it was one of the worst kind of food I have had in a very long time.Thn had adhraki chicken..was even worse thn the starter.Left the place hungry and angry.Sorry but the food was really not even edible good.|negative
Rated Well to put it simply it was a disaster of a decision to order food from this place. Not a single thing was edible. Presentation was bad and packing seemed as if i had ordered from road side kiosk. Everything came wrapped in an aluminium foil. I mean how can someone screw up fish and chips. Well they managed to do that as well. As soon as the fork went inside the fish, the entire crust came off as a wrapper. Fish was cold inside and soggy. Chips were cold too and hard to chew. And crust, well it went to the bin after a single bite. Garlic bread had only one topping - Garlic, and loads of it. We had to literally scrub the topping off to make it edible. Last thing was a shawarma, which read "the traditional chicken shawarma". It should rather be named - "the traditional beetroot shawarma". It could well be termed as healthy for the amount of beetroot it had inside, but it was definitely not a traditional chicken shawarma. Packing - 1/5 (and they charge for packing.) Delivery - 2/5 (30 mins late and they charge for it too, even on orders more than their minimum order. The only reason for a 2 here is because delivery boy duly apologised before i could say anything about the late delivery.) Taste - 1/5 ( cold, soggy and NOT tasty. none of it. raw crushed Maggi with masala sprinkled over it is even more tasty)|negative
Rated The Food Bar (TFB) is the sister concern of the Spice Bazaar located in the same premises of the ever famous Bar Stock Exchange and Mc Donald's in Saki Naka. This place unfortunately is a disaster. I have just been there once during a quick office break and its a major disappointment. Ordered the mutton Burger which was the worst burger I tasted my entire life. Served with 6 wedges and salad topped with mayo , no words can express how bad the burger tasted. The place is understaffed as there is the 2 guys managing the crowd. During my brief visit, they managed to screw 2 orders in quick succession. A patron had ordered chicken pasta but had received veg pasta instead after waiting for 30 mins. Another group had to cancelled part of their starters order as the waiter served them the main course again they were made to wait over 30 mins. All of this occurred on a weekday when most people just want a quick meal. I has to wait for 30 mins for an order that was promised in 10 mins. Catching the server’s attention is another challenge as they look like they hated their job and were over-worked and confused. This joint is so mis-managed in all departments, it makes Mc Donald’s look better in product, price, quality and service. Definitely not recommended.|negative
Rated Strictly mediocre food. Ordered a vegetarian patty burger with simple instructions to not add tomatoes in it- got a pedestrian bun with a patty and lo behold three slices of tomatoes. Extremely disappointing. Traditional chicken Shawarma- Edible but Nothing great. Some shredded cabbage with bland chicken pieces in Mayo. The pictures on Zomato fooled us ... I really had hopes for this one!|negative
Rated I visited this restaurant on Sunday evening..the staff here are Not trained properly..they dont even know wat are the ingredients of a dish they are serving..in addition to the untrained staff, the major drawback of the restaurant is that if u want to have thali den go get sum 8-10 ppl wid u otherwise u vil be highly disappointed..also if u want salt n pepper keep on asking the waiter for the same which ideally needs to be on ur table. A BAD EXPERIENCE!!|negative
Rated Definately a NO. I had been there with huge expectations as the restaurant being a 5 star. But the plce is dissapointing as far as food is concerned. Starters were okay. Soup turned out to be at a room temperature. Main course was bad except the Dal makhani which was delicious. Deserts were the only ones that saved our day. No doubt the staff was friendly but food was pathetic.|negative
Rated I had high expectations for this place. Unfortunately, Calendar's Kitchen didn't quite match up. I ordered a chicken machboos for lunch via Swiggy (now these guys are great). I've had authentic chicken machboos in the Middle East before, so I had an approximate idea of what I was getting myself into. I wasn't expecting the real thing but I did expect something close at the very least. So here's what I got. Mildly spiced rice tossed together with cloves of garlic, chopped tomatoes and onions. The garlic, tomatoes and onions felt woefully undercooked. I cannot stand raw tomatoes. Also, it was seriously lacking salt. On the plus side, I imagine it must have been quite healthy considering all of the above. So yeah, +1 for that. Perhaps I should've stuck to hummus and pita, as I'd initially planned. Definitely won't be ordering rice from here, again.|negative
Rated Let me start with the bad aspects of the shining armour of sakinaka. The hotel, not to be seen anywhere in the locality, extremely difficult to map as its located in a pathetic and barren area. Since my foodie orgasms always push me to go for every new restaurant in any locality, i was forced to visit. So I reach there and find out that they have good food, but poor service delivery towards its customers. There was absolutely noone except our table for lunch. Hence we expected them to customize their service and try to be flexible to their onpy customers this afternoon. But they failed there big time. Even small requests like increasing the air conditioner temperature or increasing the volume of the music were not accepted. At the end of the meal, they announced that we had to pay the bill using cash only and their card machine was not working. Since we were around 10 of us, none was carrying a lot of cash to pay the bill, but they forced us to go walk a mile and get the cash withdrawn. It was the last thing expected from a hotel business. In case they had informed us in the beginning, we could have done some arrangements. Then they expected us to write good reviews in their dairy. Disaster lunch day. They screwed their tasty food quality by their pathetic service.|negative
Rated Went there for breakfast & had awful overall experience. Ambience was bad, no hygiene, very slow service, not cordial staff. I believe these things can still be ignored, if the food is good but that was even worse. Tried dosa & I can assure this was the worst masala dosa I have tasted in Mumbai. I had interaction with few more customers in the restaurant & everybody shared the same feelings. A strict no-no for this restaurant. Better to be avoided.|negative
Rated They have a sit down chicken /non veg lunch buffet @399 pp on weekends. As per the concept you can order one soup, starter, main course, NAANS, rotis, parathas, kulchas and rice as many times you want but you can only repeat the same dish again. They also give you a soft drink or buttermilk unlimited. We got Chicken amritsari kebabs and Chicken crunchy for starters. Chicken Manchow soup Dal makhani, Naan, Kulchas and Parathas. These items were good. For main course we ordered Chicken tawa and Chicken in bbq sauce with mushrooms and only one chicken fried rice as we were feeling full. Main course tastes average. Butter scotch ice cream as desserts. The dessert is limited, you can get ice-cream or Gulab jamun. Service is decent no issues just the food takes a while to arrive. They have plenty of parking space too. Only the bad part is the location of Sakinaka which can deter people from coming. As a suggestion they should allow to choose from multiple items for repeat instead of ordering the same one.|negative
Rated Been there on a rainy sunday night. This place is located very inside and is hard to find. The ambience is simple and pleasant. The food is amazing. The service is pathetic. Don't waste the food they charge you 50% of the entire bill we're let off with an warning. But I'd again visit this place only for the food and nothing else.|negative
Rated Had gone for midnight buffet and let me tell u this place is really bad ....though the ambience was good food was equally bad. Only thg which I iked was dessert ...|negative
Rated We accidentally landed up here. Our plan was to head to Holiday Inn, but a wrong turn and loads of traffic played catalyst for our visit to this hotel. The menu on zomato is outdated, wonder why they wudnt update the new continental/Italian menu on zomato. The menu is exhaustive, but surprisingly risotto does not find a mention in it. This ambiance is decent but service is a little slow. We were here on Friday at around 630 and they were busy preparing for the evening buffet. We ordered for 1. Gardenia pizza 2. Picco polo chicken pizza 3. Coleslaw sandwhich 4. Hummus platter 5. Chilly chicken 6. Fruit sangria 7. Beers The pizza were average. Not a very big fan of thick crust and they dint have the option for thin crust. The hummus platter was not bad and so was the sandwich. The chilly chicken was overtly spicy and took a lot out of to actually consume it. The sangria was a mix of juices with some fruits thrown in, at 300 was expensive. Overall a decent place to catch up on work if you around, foods nothing to write home about though.|negative
Rated I've been a regular at this place for the past 5 years ignoring allegations that they adulterate their expensive whiskies when ordered , treat their customers like shit , over bill their customers .......... All because I had till date never faced the same issue . Off late though ,this has been testing my patience . From waiters trying to get you leave by 12 am on a Saturday night ( just because we were the lone table ,mind you they generally are open till 1 am ,but what the hell ..... Lone table , let's make them scramble under false pretense and leave early home said the waiters I guess) to them making fuss over 4 people occupying a table of 6 on a lonely late Sunday eve (when the entire bar was empty except for that 1 table we were trying to occupy) to the final straw that occurred today . Saturday eve - it's 11.00 pm and just because there's no one else patronizing them (I guess you have these fools to blame for their shoddy practices), they make an excuse that they close early on Saturday nights ! Even my neighbourhood udipi restaurant is open post 11 pm . Never stepping foot in this rotten diseased excuse of a bar ever again !|negative
Rated Dear friends, please do not consider this restaurant at all.... specially for home deliveries...... they are just pathetic in their services....... I had ordered through zomato online today at 12.39 PM and paid the bill amount online thru netbanking. As per the confirmation received from zomato the food was suppose to get delieverd by 1.19 PM. Till 1.30 the food didnt reach me and hence it made me call the restaurant ppl to check.... Their reply was so irritating as they told dat dey dont have much clue that why food wasnt delivered. On asking the number of the delivery boy they gave the number but at the same time they said that the person is not answering any calls now (Highly irresponsible). meanwhile thru zomato chat i had also asked zomato representative to help tracing the order. When she called the restaurant they told the same thing to her as1 well that the person is not picking up the call.... This is the kinda service they provide.....after several calls the delivery boy picked up the call and said that he had come for delivery and he had called on the registered number frm the gate but no one received the call..... I was surprised to know this as i didnt got any call frm that person...... i asked him wen u will come and deliver the food and he told that he wud be reaching in 10 minutes. He didn't turn up again for next half n hour........i and zomato representative continuously tried to call the fellow and he was not answering the call (his callertune as well is so damn annoying - call 7302142879 to check)..... After all this he came with parcel at 2.20 pm.... on asking him about the entire thing instead of apologizig he started arguing that he had called multiple times. After checking the details we noticed that the number printed on the bill was only wrong. (Again the restaurants mistake) as the number routed through zomato was absolutely correct. When the food arrived it was not warm and the taste was also very ok type of..... zomato called me to apologize for the entire nuisance but the restaurant didnt have courtsey to call and apologize. After zomato investigated further about the delay the restaurant confirmed that there were 2 mistakes frm their side 1. They passed the order late to chef 2. They copied wrong number frm zomato. Restaurant manager after discussion with zomato just called to apologize in a casual way....... rather considering this restaurant you have multiple options near sakinaka like 5 spice, main land china, shiv sagar etc....... plz order from somewhere else and not frm here...... on asking about refund of the restaurant he just said that he will check the feasibility and get back but i knw very well that he will never call back and never give the refund. Bakwaas service, average food and high price......|negative
Rated Yeh!!!!! Fat Kong, !!! After long time I order food from Fat kong of Fat kong Box, it was quite good!!! but they have to improve all about the test of food. any way it was not so bad too. thanks Fat kong..... see you again with best pleassures.............|negative
Rated I have stayed here once with my family During a flight layover It's quite nice The food was 6/10 Ambience 6/10 Service 6/10 N isn't expensive Next time I got a few hrs to crash near the airport This won't be a bad option !!|negative
Rated Have ordered Twice from this place now. 1st time it was singapore noodles. Did not like it. Thought to ourselves may be we ordered wrong. Gave it a 2nd try shortly after. It was wanton soup and phad thai. Wanton soup: Bland. No flavour. Phad thai: Noodles were thick. I am not sure putting star anise in chinese is a good idea. It is usually in biryani. The noodles were fairly dry too. Extremely disappointing taste overall. Quantity was large, but what does one do with Quantity if the taste isn't good? Having experienced the food, I seriously doubt the reviews raving and singing praises for this restaurant here. Not ordering again from here.|negative
Rated We had a nice reunion of our group during India Vs Pak WC T20 match. Loved the music and the ambience! Apart from drinks and the usual mainstream starters, we tried something new and it failed to appease us. Pepper blasted chicken and prawns poppers. Pepper blasted chicken was too oily and was overloaded with peppery essence which was irritating. I don't know whether it was some fault on that particular day since it is mentioned in the recommended dishes.|negative
Rated Horrible place never been so decided to try it regret that decision I made will never come here at all ordered salad horrible taste... Ordered tomato soup and veg clear soup the worst I ever had... I prefer the food bar and jugheads they make better soup that this is garbage and the noise is horrible I told them to reduce the volume they said sorry we can't it was pathetic service they werr rude....|negative
Rated The only good thing about the place is the ambience. Apart from that everything is quite screwed up. To a get a table when atleast 4-5 tables were empty on a Sunday evening, it took them 4 people and 15 mins. Service is even worse. They pretty much turn a deaf ear to anything you say. People come listen to you and don't bother about it. They do things at their own sweet pace. Quite an annoying experience.|negative
Rated Bloody stupid staff. And equally rude. I called them for reservation they told you directly walk in. I spend 90mins to reach this place thanks to traffic, and what I am greeted with: no stag entries and table reservation only. When I argued they were ready to let me in with a cover charge of 3000 pp. a good way to discourage. You spoiled a very precious evening and Also spoiled the mood of my guest. I am gonna make you guys pay for this...|negative
Rated The place is massive! Has a really chill vibe to it. If you love dancing till late then please head over here with your squad. You will not be disappointed.|negative
Rated I personally found this place a bit over hyped. The ambience is okay, nothing so different except THE LITTLE DOOR to enter. Getting a seat here is difficult especially on weekends so make sure you have a reservation. The drinks are slightly expensive compared to many other similar places. If you don't wish to spend a lot, try to visit during happy hours or offer periods. All the dishes that we ordered were just average.|negative
Rated Daytime drinking on a warm sunday afternoon is always a good idea. If this thought inspires you, head out to TLD between 12 -4 for a sunday brunch. It's crazy! They have various set menus to order from with or without alcohol. It's not exactly cheap but if you plan on binge drinking then it might just be. The crowd is crazy, by 2pm it gets very full so if you want a table you have to come in on time. They even have karaoke so by 3-4 there are far too many drunk people singing out of tune. The only grouse in all of this is the service. After a while when the crowd starts filling in, it becomes impossible for the waiters to keep a tab on the drinks and who ordered what. We had our entire order messed up and things coming in after an hour. Also the food sucked, but I blame that more on the bad order management than the cooking. With so many orders and blunders i guess they started resorting to making whatever comes their way. It's a mad sunday afternoon!|negative
Rated Had been der for breakfast buffet,highly dissapointin,very limited menu,i was wondering why rotis n biryani was on buffet for breakfast???had ordered masala omlate from live counter which never reached me inspite of reminder...bad experience overall.not recomonded|negative
Rated Looks like a pretentious place with random people who pretend to be all sophisticated. We ended coming here by fluke just to pass a few minutes and utterly disappointed with the decision. Wastage of a great property I feel|negative
Rated The food was satisfactory . Nothing very different from the usual pan- Asian dishes . Was very unhappy with the service and promptness of the staff . Very slow service|negative
Rated A place with live music and relaxed ambience. The service was so slow as it took them half an hour to find us a table in an empty bar. It seemed as if the staff was too busy doin nothing. Even our order took more than 45 mins. We ordered a cocktail and a veg sushi. The cocktail was average nothing great to boast of. The veg sushi was good. As we wer hungry we ordered an Italian burger which was the biggest disappointment of d night. The burger bun was very hard and was a total disaster. Having had enough of bad experience we checked out to fufill our hunger pangs elsewhere.|negative
Rated It bothers me when you call a place at 11:40am, and they respond with "We open at 12" It bothers me a little bit more when you politely ask if they can take down your order now since it's 20 minutes away and they can process it at 12, and they respond with "No, you need to call back at 12" It bothers me a lot when I do call back at 12 and they tell me what I was calling for is not available (Burgers)... Could have saved 20 minutes of my time heading into Lunch, but I guess that's not their problem.|negative
Rated Known for their gyro's they serve huge, messy and absolutely delicious portions. No this is not a place for a first date unless you want to be seen licking that dripping sauce and gobbling up on the yum filling. Would pick this over Carter blue any day.|negative
Rated This is my ALL-TIME favourite place. Literally. The souvlaki, Veg Gyros (extra feta cheese and garlic mayo) are to die for. Ever since I visited Greece in 2013, I had been looking for places that would serve the same street side souvlaki I had in Santorini and the exactly after two months I discovered this place.|negative
Rated Wish I could rate a -1 😈 for this sorry excuse of an Eatery. Unkempt... Lacks ventilation... Place smelt like burnt toast more like charred honestly. Staff is too busy ogling at women than doing their job. Coffee was poor for lack of a better word which we ended up making it a To go cup as experience was stifling and skipped dessert altogether. This place is a namesake compared to it's bandra sister concern. Avoid!!!|negative
Rated Burger King is just a brand name, nothing else.. I had big hopes from them but disappointed.. Really bad.. They serve big buns and and small tiny patties in them... Even the cheese they give for which they charge huge extra amount, is bad.. It's cold and dry put into an already made burger, just reopen the burger, put the cheese and repack it.. The place is very clean but service is as staple for BK, is bad...|negative
Rated overhyped. Like what the hell. :-\ and the indoor seating set up is just not working out. And the worst portion sizes in the history of serving portion size and charging that kind of money. Just because it's in town does not mean it can fool people :-||negative
Rated The only thing good about the place is the music and the sorta hot co-owner who was a model or acted in ads. The food is terrible though. We ordered the Mexican Fiesta Bowl, which honestly was leftover vegetable pulav that smelled odd and it had "sour cream" (Basically Raita. Who they tryna fool? I know what sour cream tastes like) . The Pancho's Punch Salad sure punched my teeth in as the chicken in it was TOUGHER than my P.E coach in school. Please avoid this mirage of a cool eatery. Guess they're fond of corn as they overdid it in both the dishes. Thank God we didn't order more! I question the credibility of the people who gave the damn place anything more than 3.5. They're either food blogger sell outs or people with just bad taste. UPDATE: Both my friend and I, got stomach aches and the runs later.|negative
Rated By far the worst place I've been to for Mexican food. This place was very disappointing due to several reasons. Mainly due to it being infested with mosquitos! Because of that we had to change our table and go outside! The service here is pathetic as well. The waiter is really dumb and slow for everything. He took like 10 minutes to get us our bottle of water. After waiting for 25 minutes, he tells us the loaded nachos with guacamole will take few minutes extra as the nachos was over and they had to go get some from outside. Can you believe it?! Also called for an adobo mushroom burrito, which was nothing great. Even the chicken quesadillas with cheese was not good at all. Though the place was pretty much empty I have no idea why they took so long to get the food, that to horrible food. I guess only the place is done up decently. Even when we paid our bill he took like 10 minutes to get the change. I don't understand how this place has got an overall rating of 4.0! I am never ever going to this place ever again even if I'm dying of hunger!|negative
Rated Uba tuba gave me the most disappointing visit in bandra after a really long time.I have no words to express how bad my experience was here !! Being a sunday this place was empty and me and my ladylove were really hungry so we decided to eat here thinking we might get the food fast but it was all in vain. After 25 minutes of us waiting they told us that the nachos were not in stock and they had called it from outside (pathetic). Another turn off are the mosquitos which bit us so much that we had to change our seating and go outside ! Not much has been done to take care of these flying creatures!! The waiter took 10 minutes to give us a bottle of water. We ordered for overloaded nachos with extra guacamole which was fairly good and tasted better due to our hunger !! The adobo mushroom burrito was average while the adobo chicken quesadilla was really bad except for the cheese in it!! The chicken didnt taste mexican at all !! Ambience is good but they really need to do something about their staff and service because its in negative points. And to top it all we badly wanted to leave from there but again our coolio waiter took 10 mts to get the change back. This was the first and last time i came here and am in no mood to visit this so called mexican outlet again !!|negative
Rated Best Frankies I ever had in Mumbai, If I am in Lokhandwala I make sure that I should not miss the Franky of Breadkraft. My favourite picks are Veg Manchurian, Paneer Manchurian, Paneer Chilly , Cheese Paneer, Veg Schezuan Cheese etc. Just have one franky & you are done. Must try place.|negative
Rated The place and it's offerings does full justice to the name - Guilt Trip! With a plethora of desserts, pastries and indulgences, this is the perfect place to end any friends outing, family dinner or date. The ambience is quite good with an open place outside this desserts shop. It is not very crowded also, so that gives an extra point to ambience. Chocolate hazelnut, chocolate ganache, rainbow, fererro mousse, lemon cheesecake, Croissants, just try anything and you won't be complaining for sure!|negative
Rated Yummy variety of cupcakes!! Mind blowing experience ....developed a food crush for red velvet cheese cake after this trip. Awesome dessert droll !! PHD's tip : don't be guilty at all to voyeur into this trip...thou shall never regret!!|negative
Rated Came here with friends for lunch. So bad, it makes me never want to eat shawarma, ever again. I ordered an oriental chicken shawarma, received it within 10 minutes, cold as ice though. Asked them why it was cold, the cashier said "sir voh sauce thanda hota hain toh thoda thanda hota hi hain shawarma" and my friends received their shawarmas in another 10 minutes and it was hot even though they put their 'cold sauces'. I wouldn't ever want to come back here. I would recommend even you don't. Please.|negative
Rated Delivery order for club sandwich , spicy chicken shawarma and chicken greek salad. Greek salad should have shredded chicken however it had shawarma chicken. It ruined the taste of salad. Chicken shawarma pita was ok but not spicy as we asked for. Shawarma had very less quantity of chicken in it which is ok coz cost of shawarma is also not much. Club sandwich was ok.|negative
Rated This place has added a new aspect to ice-creams – surprising our taste buds with customised make yourself flavours. Plus, it’s not only a ice-cream parlour, it’s a dessert parlour cum small eateries with choice of waffles, sandwiches, Churros & salad. But the mainstay is their Stone Cold Ice Creams and other scrumptious desserts – pancakes, churros & waffles. ... Read full post on travellersdeliciouslife.blogspot.com|negative
Rated Summer has set in with the heat, sweat and thirst for something cold. So Lets do the Hokey Pokey.... Well known for there signature stone creations Hokey Pokey store at Carters is appealing and inviting from outside. In 2014 I had the opportunity to savour 30 ice cream creations in a month... Yes I repeat 30 ice creams one for each day of the month. I have watched it being prepared on that icy slab and beaten brown and yummy with all those topping and combinations and turned into a piece of Art. However my computer crashed and all those pictures I had taken have gone now. Double Chocolate, very Very berry, minty chocolate have been my favourites. Love they way they serve it up in a waffle cup. They have regular flavours too. A must have is the delicious kaju-gulkand flavor. anahitairani200.wordpress.com|negative
Rated The original idea is always cold stone as the outlet is nicely designed and hygiene at its best; copy this and you have hokey pokey; flavors gone for a toss, too much of sugary syrup being loaded in already sweet ice cream; i think its time one should balance this out and worse part in case you do it the outlet is in hand of bunch of new gen. crowd who does not care about customers all they want is to shove the ice cream as in this crazy nation wherein population drives the demand; as next order is always waiting Btw ordered apple base ice cream and was surprised to see that the last broken waffle cone was crushed to make the best use of ingredient with loads of apples dipped in sugary syrup. One word - Reevaluate.|negative
Rated A must visit. Difficult to locate at first but overall a great experience. We got to try the blueberry cheesecake jar, the lemon meringue waffles, chicken sandwich, corn and cheese sandwich, potato wedges and the pink velvet cupcake. Every item made us crave for more. We wanted to try out each and every item they offered. A must visit.|negative

Rated Been to love and cheesecake before but not this outlet. Ordered Philadelphia cheesecake, tiramisu, Belgian chocolate cheesecake and Belgian bomb. The tiramisu cheesecake is for coffee lovers. Belgian bomb and Belgian cheesecake for dark chocolate lovers. The difference between Belgian cheesecake and bomb is only the size and the hard chocolate around the Belgian bomb nothing else. Didn't try the Philadelphia cheesecake coz not a fan of plain cheesecake but my friend liked it so it might be good. 😋 It was value for money much cheaper than what I had before at the lokhandwala .The only problem was the seating.|negative
Rated Late Night Icecream Cravings when in Bandra, Came to this place :) There were only 6 flavors out of which only 1 was chocolate so I went for it. Had the Medium Belgian Chocolate Icecream with Oreo Base and Strawberry, Kiwi and chocolate chunks as toppings. It was yummy but super expensive. The icecream was 200/- Each topping was somewhat 60/- Total was 420. Which is costly according the Size of the icecream 😮|negative
Rated Set among the plethora of cafes and eateries off Bandra's Carter Road, Yogurtbay is just a tiny nook. In fact, I doubt two customers could enter the place at once. Thankfully, the place was empty of any customers when I walked by. Except for a punk rocker enjoying his yogurt who then turned out to be the guy running the place. Yogurtbay has three soft serve machines churning out frozen yogurt and a few dozen toppings on the counter (fruits, nuts, chocolates, everything under the sun). I got confused by the options and asked the guy to suggest. Which was a good thing because his bestselling topping was hidden under the counter. So the little tub I got is called frozen blueberry cheesecake. First he put some cake crumbs in the tub. Then a rather large serving of blueberry frozen yogurt, a topping of canned blueberries and finally some more cake crumbs for a truly delicious treat. bombayfoodie.com|negative
Rated After having a sugary round at their neighbor place thought of trying this outlet with Strawberry flavor (just reviewed one); excessed an option for more topping for which they charges 45 per topping; no issues but half of spoon of each on topping and that too in overflowing cup (complete rip off); and above all the person wiped this with it so called plastic glove and started serving next.....ugggh....one spoon and the cream was given to needy on the doorsteps Grow up team seems like we have a long wait to have a good ice-cream outlet|negative
Rated The once fantastic restaurant is now just average, over priced food. Used to like visiting Nom Nom earlier. However yesterday had a terrible experience. The service was painfully slow, the food was pathetic. There are so many better options available in this price range! Avoid this place for any disappointment.|negative
Rated Worst Chinese food on the planet with horrible service. Can't explain the pathetic experience we had a couple of days back. They don't care for their guests|negative
Rated Stomach is a poorly maintained place, So expectations of hygiene will disappoint you. My friends and I dined in the AC section..where the AC barely worked. They are severely short staffed and the service is extremely slow. We were left waiting for more than 45 minutes for our order and the waiters were deaf to our complaints. The prices of cold drinks in the menu are misleading which when pointed out by us, lead to the amount for complementary schezwan sauce add to the bill. Also the waiters will be happy to cancel your orders without any remorse after they've not brought it out for an hour after you placed the order. So overall, it's a dirty place, with rude staff, decent food which does not make up for the otherwise pathetic service. I personally plan to never visit it again. It also rate it less than 1 if that was possible.|negative
Rated One of the most kickass and happening places to be on a Friday, Saturday & Sunday! Finally got a good place to chill out at in Bandra. Oh, and the Burgers are to die for!|negative
Rated Totally biased managers. Initially told to wait 5-10 mins and kept us on hold allowing other 'cooler' public to enter. We even asked that the open sitting area is fine for us. Later after holding us for around 45 mins manager comes and says with lot of attitude that as we wanted only air conditioning he didnt give the seat to us. Never seen such bad attitude from managers. Horrible experience.|negative
Rated First of all, a very very difficult place to find between the club. No branding outside, people might save much time if there's a branding outside on the road. Food quality is average. Called for Paneer Pasanda, Roti and Baked Spaghetti. Overall the place and environment is quite noisy. Can visit once in a while. Not too recommended.|negative
Rated The first thing that happens when i seat myself on a 6 seater table is, the staff asks me how many people would be coming since you are currently only two. I tell him 6, and all would join in within 10-15 minutes. He says- "ok, time starts". After 10 minutes by the watch he comes and tells us your friends haven't reached yet and I tell him that yes they are on their way, plus I don't see many tables occupied anyways in the restaurant, you would have to trust us. He says, " but I can't stop the phones from ringing." After 3 more of my friends arrive and we are chatting while deciding what to eat, rhe staff member comes again and says, "what are you waiting for to place your order? Christmas?" After 5 minutes while we are still waiting for our sixth friend to arrive who is stuck in traffic, the same staff comes again and remarks- "how many people did you say were coming?" Heights of disrespecting the customers. @Staff of PJ's - please understand, as customers we pay not just for the food, but for the experience. I wouldn't take away the rating of the food from you though. Highly unsatisfied and unpleasant experience.|negative
Rated Nostalgia is just an underrated word when it comes to PJ's. Lots and lots of good time spent and memories cherished at this place. Be it bday parties or first salary party, or college farewell parties, pj's has always been the preferred Choice. Food is decent and the alcohol is Damn cheap. You just have to pay some 50-100 Rs entry fee and that's it. On weekends it gets a bit difficult to get a table here. My suggestion would be to reach here at around 7.30 PM, chill relax a bit, have your drinks and some starters, set the mood and later head off to party the Bandra way. Service was a bit slow earlier but now they have significantly improved. Guys keep in mind one thing before visiting this place. They follow strict dressing code policy. You have to wear shoes and full pants for getting an entry inside. Damage done: no damage essentially, just good decently priced food and drinks and a whole lot of fun.|negative
Rated So the other day I pland to go here with few frnds f mine I didn't really like the place too much of loud music it was annoying caffe terra was kk nt gr8 Nt bad average food was horrible I had ordered 4 5 things didn't like any of the stuff Tht I had orderd over all a very very very poor experience Nt worth the money Tht I spent ..|negative
Rated I was really disappointed with this place. The food was really bad. The pasta which we ordered was tasteless and the pizza had too much pepper in it. The furniture at this place is all old and worn out. The place is not at all maintained. The service was very slow. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.|negative
Rated I had ordered for Small portion of Salad with Chicken and a certain kind of sauce. The sauce and chicken were clearly not sufficient for the quantity of the salad. Next up I had ordered for Chicken Quesadillas with Garlic Bread. The Garlic Bread was not delivered, and the Quesadillas were bland and cold and not crunchy by the time we put it in our mouth. Lastly, the Pasta. It was undercooked, no salt, and very thick. Utterly saddening experience. Not recommended. Poor standard of food.|negative
Rated Eating and ordering a pasta over here was a pain in the evening. There were only 2 other tables occupied, however, the staff was incompetent and had no idea how they made us wait 40 mins for it. Sometimes it's worth waiting for good food, but out of 4 pastas ordered, 1 was not eatable, 2 were barely eatable, and the last one was eaten by 4 of us, and we're still dissappointed. Not going here again!|negative
Rated On a very lazy Saturday afternoon, I was invited for a tasting session at this little eatery in the by-lanes of Pali Hill. There is just an an outside seating area with a live kitchen where they cook with fresh ingredients. So, there were 5 of us and we decided to sample a few coolers and brunch items. Hits aka Highly recommended: Cold Coffee Mint Mojito Litchi Mojito Blackcurrant Mojito Lemon Ice Tea Masala Omelette Paneer Bhurji in a pav Chilli Cheese scrambled eggs Chicken Bruschetta Veg Bruchetta All Spice baked mushroom Misses: Kiwi Mojito Peanut Butter toast We ordered a spaghetti in classic tomato. It was extremely unappetizing and had way too much garlic. The best pat about this eatery is that it is very decently priced. So make sure you visit the place ASAP. :)|negative
Rated I ordered soup which was not at all spicy, i orderd crispy chicken which was way toooo salty that we had to leave it, then finally we ordered thai green curry which was not at all spicy and was way toooooo sweet , nd one of the disappointing thing was they dont serve wine ... I would want mr.ashish the owner to try all these things an post a review of there restaurant. I regret giving a miss call on the number mention for the vote ..!!|negative
Rated I don't usually go veg but my daddy is a very disciplined , health conscious person so he would often take me here. When multiplexes weren't around and centre one was the only one in Vashi, we had theatres running successfully in Vashi which is close to Navaratna. Post film,we would often come here. I had my best of Pav Bhajis, Chole batoras, Idlis and yummy dosas out here. The sabzis were never bland. I would insist on getting fruit juices too. We were always full and getting up would be so damn difficult. Navratna is always filled with people. Getting a seat is a big deal. Very crowded area it is. Once you manage a seat, you are sure to have best of your times.😊|negative
Rated Rate : 5 on 5 for food, hygiene, ambience, service and every other thing. Your small tiny mouth falls too short for the huge wide burgers!! Too luscious in taste with its creamy tangy sauces, with its mouth melting patty and Crispy potato Fries, which will keep no space in your teeny-weeny stomach ;) Had See-ra-cha burger before, so thought of trying something new. Came upon with, Chicken Cheese burger and Shrooms Melt. I, being a non vegetarian, find Vegetarian burgers too boring to have but this place completely changed my mind!! Shrooms Melt is such a mouth-watering burger with mushrooms all over and tasted more yum than any Chicken burger! It's a Must have BURGER!! What to say about the proportions ! It's too hard to even complete one entire burger ! Love this place. Keep it up ;)|negative
Rated Right next to the Inorbit Mall, Vashi. Ain't that hard to find the place. Not really a salad person hence we straight away ordered Chicken in Herb Sauce and Oreo Shake. The dish is a combination of rice in cream sauce and mashed potato. The experimental dish is probably one of the reason why I won't mind visiting this place again and again. The Oreo Shake wasn't bad either. Not much to say on the ambiance but I like the seating and the posters on the wall. Thumbs up for good food and the staff|negative
Rated Pizza Hut as a chain has has gone down not just in service but also in taste. The staff is so ignorant that even after telling him to clean the table twice he turns up after 2 mins and service is very poor they just keep the plates and cutlery at the side of the table and not even bothered to have a look that the plates are more than number of guests. The service was always slow but now the scenario is hardly any services the standards are just going worst every-time you visit. Had ordered for Garlic bread exotica and Exotica Pizza taste wise both were okay nothing great. Disappointed and dissatisfied from Pizza Hut as a chain completely.|negative
Rated Village has always been a place where you get a plethora of vegetation food from starters to main course to dessert course, (though many of the dishes have always been run-of-the-mill) fun with foot tapping folk and contemporary music, good hospitality filled with village themed counters and decor. They also have recently started serving Non-Veg in their desserts section and dessert section is moved/accommodated in the starters section. In the course of my three recent visits, I have observed the taste of food is diminishing from mediocre to bad, not even a single dish stands out. For instance, sabzis had excessive amount of spices, the buttermilk was overly diluted, , Moong Daal halwa was ruined by overcooking etc. And finally on a very serious note, I noticed that one of the staff members was putting the remainder starters (The left-overs from people's plate, even dipped in sauces and chutneys) in the bowl of freshly made starters. We understand that food must never be wasted but this not at all is the professional way of service and hospitality. Highly disappointed. Not recommended PS: They also have increased the prices.|negative
Rated Not only did i find the lack of light in a dining place unappealing, I did not enjoy their croques suzette as well. Ordered for the peanut butter shake, that was also too too bitter! Overall, a pricey meal which I just did not enjoy!|negative
Rated After numerous failed plans i finally managed to catch up with an old friend cum ex colleague. Of course we have moved up the corporate ladder, the bickering still continues. Hence the place had to be not really noisy. So we settled for this place. The terrace view of 8th floor and an open seating is a good setting as its quite uncommon for this city, the place was filled with boisterous teenagers, crooning and swaying to 'Afghan Jalebi', as it had a party section also! We were famished so quickly settled for the starters that the server suggested. Chicken filled with cheese was good. For the maincourse, after a lot of brainstorming and few rounds of beer, we settled for chicken bhuna and plain roti and that too didnt disappoint! For the service, it was friendly and unintrusive. For the setting, it was unique and tastefully done. Though the chairs were a bit uncomfortable, which we mentioned in the feedback also!|negative
Rated Very bad.... we went in and it was empty as drat... staff too ignorant.... we had to storm out n try sm odr place... so we went next door to 3 wise monkeys. Wait up for the review. Light House Cafe... SHAME ON YOU GUYS|negative
Rated Visited this place for a family function . Cockroachs near food counter . Stone in food . Unbelievable and unimaginable. I pointed out the Cockroach to the cook and I was shocked with his reaction " THERE WAS NO REACTION" I have never seen this kind of callous behaviour of any person ever . Even a round side joint would react with more common sense. Then the Manager was summoned and he shoved the Cockroach with his hand so the Cockroach disappeared on the floor, sure to resurface again . People beware and eat food here at your own risk . Food Inspectors should visit this place with open eyes. Half hour after my review on Zomato the said cook meets me in the lobby whilst I am leaving the premises and he threatened me and dared me to write such a review. People had to intervene and take him away. He was certainly an evening and function spoiler . Some advised me to file a police complaint. I left the place very very disappointed.|negative
Rated This place has a really good ambience but the food is not worth. I don't know about the non vegetarians but for vegetarians, it is simply a waste. We ordered cheesy fries, berry pulao and okra which were the recommended ones but that was the worst food I had. Also the quantity of the drink was less and all the items are overpriced. Never had such a bad rice for 450 bucks. I don't know how did it get the popularity but I'm never gonna visit or recommend anyone.|negative
Rated I was told that the food here is amazing beyond par so we decided to go here for dinner one night. Our mistake? We picked a Friday night. The place was PACKED to say the least. There was barely any leg space and we ended up encroaching on someone else's table to just get a place to stand. They have an in-house special cocktail called Saat Rasta. Disclaimer: it's not for the weak hearted. It's not a very big place but it does really well for itself given the kind of crowd that was willing to stand through the hours just to be there. For a place so happening, it's a shame that they have to shut it at 1 am by hook or by crook. Definitely coming back for more|negative
Rated Gokul is the iconic booze restaurant next to Bademiyaan. So many memories come back to me when I think about Gokul. If you want to do a night out, follow this sequence of order: Eat at any restaurant in Colaba (Bademiyaan is preferred), have some cheap liquor in Gokul and go crazy the whole night! Ambiance is pretty dark and has congested seating. The food/chakhna is good alongwith the actual reason why you would visit Gokul!|negative
Rated Bisleri was more chilled,then the beer. One rude waiter. Do not order egg dishes.Too much of diluted beer.May be a bad day for them.Not sure i would visit them again.|negative
Rated This outlet doesn't even stand close to the one which is in Thane. Disgusting service. First off, we opted for the noon buffet. Absolutely no choice if you are a vegetarian. It sometimes feels to be a sinner of the top order if you are a vegetarian. Why can't there be any desserts that are eggless? There were 2-3 different types of cake but not eggless. Hardly 3-4 dishes to eat for vegetarians. Pastas took 30-40 minutes to reach us. No veg/non-veg symbols on the food nameplate to distinguish. We were at the mercy of the representatives. The other crazy thing was, I asked on of them for a bowl so that I could serve myself some custard, and he said sir, you have to take the custard in the plate only! Who the fuck in the world eats custard over a plate. The reply was really shocking. Disastrous service and equally disastrous captains. Never going to this place again and never gonna recommend it to anyone! Really bad! I've never had to rate any eatery this bad. This is my first time. Thanks for that.|negative
Rated True tramm Trunk is a junk !! These guys don't know how to behave... Can someone please explain that how can you share a table when you are out to chill with your friends.. Empty tables and you don't get them caz they are reserved, FYI when you call them they take no reservations however... 😤�?|negative
Rated This is my first visit to united sports grill in Thane. Positive points are location, ambience, price. Negative points are slow service, bad food quality. I don't know if I visited this on a bad day. Chicken dish we ordered was not cooked properly it seems. Both of us had stomach upset next day. Hoping management will be cautious in quality.|negative
Rated Had been hear to try their buffet lunch but as soon as entered the place I was told buffet ended and then thought to try something else but waited for almost 10-15min but no one came to take order so just left the place worthless service|negative
Rated Vey bad. Was highly disappointed with the taste. Mutton rogen gosh tasted like tomato curry. The kabab was half cooked. Naan was thick n raw while eating. Tho only thing that was good was the packaging of the food. Plz don't waste your money by going or ordering food from this place. Horrible service by the delivery team. They missed out sending something we ordered, even after calling them and they agreeing to send the food no one turned up with the remaining stuff. My bill amount was 2600 and the entire amount went waste.|negative
Rated Though I have never been to this restaurant but have ordered several times from here and when am confused I simply call here for a salad and chicken dish.The chicken dishes are always juicy and succulent specially the Indian stuff.|negative
Rated So twenty of us visited this place on my birthday and had an absolutely awful experience. The place had Bollywood Karaoke that particular and hence was preferred over many other options. To our disappointment, they chose to play songs that they wanted despite our numerous requests and only five other guests apart from the twenty of us. The manager was rude and inhospitable. Food is undoubtedly good but the behaviour of the staff made the experience so unpleasant that we had to go somewhere else.|negative
Rated Don't know what time it was n what made me thought to give it a try for nothing but chicken..... the most regreting decision of today's eveing... was gone to goregaon and while returning thought to have some chicken burger, so thought to go for chicken pow at NBC... Shop was empty... chicken stuff was lying in .... I ordered for chicken salad pow ... I was given option to choose the salad... I opt for tandoori salad of orange color... I have never been to NBC before... The chicken pow was hot from outside and cold from inside ... I was absolutely feeling disgusted after having the very first bite of that chicken pow.... how any one can make such a pathetic stuff... I seriously wonder how you guys are still surviving... I'm not much a fan of MC Donadlas burger but after having chicken pow at NBC I 'll surely give 10/10 for any stuff sold out in MC'Ds.. Not visiting again ever in life... totally waste of 85 bucks... Nit worth it ...|negative
Rated Sorry guys I by mistake gave my opinion about the Carter road place which I haven't tried it. This place is basically for frozen meat,which can be cook at home. But what attracts about this place is Chicken Vada Pav. Now when I heard Chicken Vada Pav without giving a second thought I visit this place. I tried the grill chicken Vada Pav with chilly sauce and white sauce bit of mayo..it was yumm..wow is the word for it. Now coming to the bad part most things are not available to eat..and there is no proper seating arrangement. But chicken Vada Pav is a must try !!|negative
Rated Pathetic food. Chicken chives dimsums were good. But the rest of it, chicken chilly, burnt garlic rice, general tao chicken all bad taste. Even I got upset stomach that night. Didn't expect after reading such good reviews on zomato|negative
Rated Delivered on time. General tao's chicken is nice. Dimsums were very good. Do not try jiangs chilli chicken. It was pathetic ...did not taste any chilly in it and was served with little gravy. Confused people.|negative
Rated Like the stuff they sell here, but regarding ordering your food staff lacks attention, you might be first in the line to be served but unfortunately they will serve you last, because they will forget your order unless you remind them again.|negative
Rated Located near Goregaon station, very difficult to find. Went on Sunday, too much rush, waited for like half an hour, even after that had to share a table with someone else. The food makes up for all these shortcomings. If you're craving for malvan style sea food, this is the place to be!|negative
Rated As a name that is considered as one of the best for Mughlai in Mumbai, sadly, this is another one of those that has degraded itself over the years, and the restaurant by itself, deserves a rating of 3, but then, there’s a twist to this tale. ...

Rated Been here once for friend's treat. First of all their seating arrangements are not comfortable (or maybe we got the wrong table). Ambience is okay. Service was quick enough on a crowded day. Coming to the food, their mocktails didn't impressed much. Their galouti kabab was the worst i've ever tasted. Zaffrani murgh tikka was good, infact it was the highlight of the dinner. Worst part of the dinner was the main course as there was too much soda in butter chicken and the sabzi we ordered. Also the worst naan one could ever have. Maybe it was our bad luck that we had such bad experience or we ordered the wrong dishes here? Well, not sure whether I'll visit here again any soon. If i do then it won't be my treat. 😜|negative
Rated I came through this place by seeing the images n reviews on zomato, bt the experience here was very bad there was waiting for almost 1 hr for the outside seating, so v thought of seating in the Ac which was empty bt there were no staff to entertain us, they were least concerned! Maybe it was Sunday that would be one of the reasons, there was no coordination between the staff, v waited almost for half an hour just for him to bring the menu, n den again waited for the waiter to take our order, v had to get up n call the staff for each n every thing, the tables were also not clean, plus there were no forks n spoons on the table v had to wait for that also till he got them, after the starters v had to again wait for almost an hour for the main course to arrive! No doubt the food was tasty, bt the service is the first thing which is considered n the restaurant is judged n rated by the service which is provided! Every customer had complaints! 👎Never gonna visit this restaurant.|negative
Rated The food was okay. The service was quite slow. As we asked the servant he told that if you sit inside the restaurant you will get quicker service rather than sitting here you might have sat there. These words brought us in anger. Everything we preserves came after 1/2 hr. We went on Sunday evening. A place not to be visited again. 😑😑|negative
Rated i am giving one because it's the lowest I can give!! The delivery Guy never reached even after my 6 Futile calls to the restaurant and a 90 minutes long wait. It states that they deliver in 60 minutes but sometimes they don't deliver at all. Beware|negative
Rated Located in the Nh8 highway this place is similar to all the other normal dhabas. We visited this place as a part of birthday bash. The staff here is friendly. The service is slow. Music was awful. Flies here were a major issue. Veg starters were satisfactory. Paneer butter masala was good . overall its a average place to visit.|negative
Rated Worth each calorie. Visiting this place is a sin you would want to do continually. Their mango cake is so god damn awesome, it makes me crave the entire year. A slice costs oddly around 100 but it's equivalent to half a meal!!|negative
Rated Had ordered death by chocolate and Dutch truffle pastry last night. Went purely by the ratings and had huge expectations from La Braco but unfortunately the stuffs didn't meet my expectations. Found the pastries very average since I was expecting them to be exceptional.Sneha.shetty400|negative
Rated Worst experience ever. Ordered at 11pm, most items were out of stock and we ended up getting chocolate truffle and mud pie. The cakes seem to have been at least 3 days old - hard rubbery and crumbly. Absolutely pathetic and disappointing. If you can't make a customer's order, just refuse it - why cause such ever lasting damage to your brand?|negative
Rated In Bombay and here I am at a food institution that throws all logic of... "How did we survive since 1913.." to the winds. In reality you do feel awed about the fact that this place has been around way before you were born or were even intended to be born. The nostalgia of a time gone by literally screams at you. Prices are extremely affordable..rather cheap and unfortunately the quality of service hovers around that too. Don't be startled if the house cats wander into the restaurant and brush against your leg. Unaware lady guests normally end up, jumping up in alarm. A noisy bustling, no-nonsense place where the patriarch just sits at the cash register, totally unfriendly, guttural and very evident that he does not need your money and that his staff is there to be yelled at and constantly reprimanded. Politeness?? What is that?? But then again the the place is an iconic institution and you have to accept the fact that the management is trapped in this time capsule called 'colonialism'... Don't forget to gorge on the 'mawa cakes and chai'... the price is a steal! I usually gauge my food-jaunts into the following categories and then note them based on a maximum of 5.0 points: 1. Ambience [decor, acoustic and overall eye-worthiness] 2.0 2. Menu Choice and Variety 5.0 3. Staff Friendliness 2.0 4. Hygiene 2.0 5. Value for Money 5.0 6. Portion size 3.5 7. Parking 0.0 [General roadside parking, not to be attributed to the promoters of the restaurant please... please] 8. Taste 4.0 9. Music 0.0 [none... ] 10. Feel-good high on leaving 3.0|negative
Rated We were looking for a place for breakfast and reached here somehow, the place was full on Sunday morning, but we got our seats after some time. The waiter ruined the morning for us, he was very rude, and he was talking like he is "The Boss" there and he does not need any customer there. He said, just order whatever I am telling you else you won't get anything. (That too very rudely) :'D so we ordered veg patties, custard and Irani tea and made our way towards home. :D So, overall a bad and kind of funny experience there, food was also average there, except for custard which was very good.|negative
Rated Located on Film City Rd; you cant happen to miss sighting this place. The cake and food taste is regular however the fact that its open till wee hours make it our choice for any urgent cake/food requirements.|negative
Rated Average food . Sweets areee really bad though dont even try it .... Though service is also bit late .. They take mostly 1 hour for food delivery also .|negative
Rated My experience with bindaas binge turned out to be a very bad experience of ordering cake . The story is that I had ordered a freshly baked cake on a special occasion and had stated the delivery time of the order to be delivered. When the day arrived for the cake to be delivered I had to remind them of my order and the person who had taken the order was not aware of the estimated time of the order to be delivered and was in a view of an evening slot for delivery inspite of mentioning the time for the cake And the end result was that the cake was stale.The cake being freshly made was guaranteed to me by the person who had taken my order It was really upsetting to see a not freshly baked cake|negative
Rated This little place has too much to offer. From pastries to cakes to snacks everything is delicious here. You will find it little overpriced as compared to monginis and ribbons and balloons but there is no compromise on the quality. Also try the franky stall here.|negative
Rated Ordered Smoked/BBQ/ Harrisa chicken sandwiches 1 choco brownie, red velvet pastry and dutch truffle. Plus points: Good packaging, Sandwiches were filling, juicy and lipsmaking. The quantity was huge. Flaws: the size of the pastry and brownies were ridiculously small. Reminded me of expensive restaurants that serve a quarter portion on wide plate.|negative
Rated A big fan of Theobroma across the city, I dropped in to the BKC outlet for a quick bite during lunch the other day. And was disappointed. First of all, the place was crowed as it was the main office lunch break time and I was trying to spot a place to sit. No help from your waiters. Then, when i found a place, i had to wait at least 20mins before somebody took my order -a simple sandwich that took again some time to get to my table. The sandwich was too hard to cut with the knife and to big/too much mayonnaise on it to be eaten with hands. So I somehow managed a combination of both... until half of my sandwich landed on the floor (my miserable attempt to cut off a piece with the knife). Again, nobody seemed to be bothered. I paid and left disappointed (and hungry). gwendaglocalista.com|negative
Rated A one off visit in 2014 Another ice creamery Oh sorry ..gelato Italiano style. This was with my team following our lunch @ Bombay Blue ( refer review). Standard flavours like everywhere else, the difference being the texture & smoothness of the cream & the flavour you have then defines your experience. Pricing as ever I complain or rant about. Why does gelato in India have to make itself more expensive? if you need millions of Indians to switch from their Amul, Vadillal, Baskin Robbins or Dinshaws... Make it reasonable to have .. !!!!|negative
Rated Have picked up sushi from here and not too bad. Tried to order delivery today and they said delivery time is 1hr 45mins!! Why do these guys bother with "delivery service".|negative
Rated Housed within the uber cool Foodhall in Palladium, sushi is part of the strange mix of stuff that's available at the in-store cafe, in case hunger pangs strike while you are indulging in some foodie retail therapy. Priced at 400/- for 8 pieces of non-veg sushi, you will not get freshly made sushi and will be directed to pick up boxes from the retail section of the store - definitely not the best way to consume sushi. Also choice is very limited with just 3 basic options - tuna, salmon and crab stick. Try only if Sushi levels in the body fall to below critical and you have no way to access it elsewhere !|negative
Rated Ramnath is a small udipi snacks place in colaba and thats it! The food is just ok..the quantity is worse. (Order for a plate of upma and youll know what i mean). Paying INR 25 for a single medu vada is not VFM.|negative
Rated Visited this place after hearing such good reviews about it but I am really sorry to say that it was a huge disappointment, didn't considered such a bad quality & worse taste food from such a old restaurant which carries it's legacy from so many years. I visited the place around 10 and maximum of its dishes were finished ( I don't know why do they keep such a tempting menu when they can't offer all), then started by ordering one chicken & mutton dish, the chicken kadai dish was not well cooked and the gravy taste was also too bad, then mutton bhuna came which taste was the best from the dishes I had at that restaurant, then I ordered for some naans and I get a reply that the naan is also finished, after such bad services still I hoped of finding next dish good and ordered mutton roast & mutton biryani which was the biggest mistake I considered as it lead to full waste of a good Sunday dinner meal, the both things literally were too bad, and the best part was he prepared mutton biryani on the spot by taking approx 1/2 an hour and calls it mughlai which mughlai restaurant on earth makes the biryani on the spot and that too in just half an hour and I think I don't need to comment about mutton roast it was that bad. So the experience was literally very bad and I will not even think of going to the place again and will suggest you all not to go there as it will lead to your spoiling of your meal.

Rated This is one of the pricey ways to have exclusive views of queen s necklace. No many food options, the view is no doubt the life of this place. If you have extra cash to burn and want to spend one of those momentous occasions you can give it a shot. One time visit|negative
Rated A couple of blocks away from The Taj Mahal hotel lies this beautiful rooftop pub with a full sea facing set up.

Rated Mumbai creams is an all Veg restaurant with a varied menu consisting of South Indian, Continental and loads of varieties in juices and deserts. Located right opposite to 5 Spice and along the lanes of Mega Mall, this restaurant is hard to miss. The foodie in us got us all curious reading their menu and we couldn’t help trying all that they had best there. There are certain things that you can definitely try here and certain things that you can do without. 1) Special Jinny Dosa – The Jinny Dosas are so called because they’re served vertically and the emerging smoke gives an illusion of an arriving Genie.

Rated One of the best places to visit for good Chinese food.. Prices are reasonable! Noodles, fried rice, Singaporean fried rice, hong kong fried rice... All are good.. Starters are also tasty.. Only one thing that i didn't like is the oyster chicken starter.. It had a foul smell!!|negative
Rated Been here after a long time last night and am sad to say the food wasn't up to the mark. We were in the mood for a large meal and started off with the chicken biryani..though the rice was decently flavoured the chicken had shrunk in size, the innards weren't cleaned and the chicken was skinny! That's all we ordered. Guess the old couple running the place have left the running to their staff and that's never the best route out.|negative
Rated This is the Bhojohori outlet I love. True, the quality of the rice they use has dropped across outlets (including at the awful Powai outlet), but not everybody is particular about these things. The rest of the food here continues to be mostly excellent. I particularly recommend: Bhetki Rongpuri (fish fry) Chicken kobiraji (minced chicken shaped into a cutlet and fried with a thick coating of egg) Koraishutir kochuri and chholar daal. Shukto (mixed vegetables in thin gravy) Mochar ghonto (curried banana flower) Padba machher jhaal (whole pabda in mustard sauce) Bhetki paturi (bhetki fillets marinated in mustard and wrapped in banana leaves) Chicken/mutton dakbunglow Basanti pulao (even though the rice is often of a poor quality these days) Nolen gurer ice-cream Of course, the bhetki pieces in the paturi are very small, but it's still worth a try every now and then. The quality of the ilish depends on the time of the year, and I find it's best not to take a risk. And I stay away from all their desserts except the wonderful ice-cream because I find they're too sweet for my palate. A couple of words here for people not used to Bengali food. The waiters generally give good advice, but they tend to follow the menu closely. But Bengalis often have plain daal and rice with the sort of stuff listed in the menu under "Starters", so if you want to mix and match, go for it. Also, note that both the chholar daal (chana daal) and basanti pulao is sweeter than one would expect in other cuisines. I've had people complain about the sweetness because they thought they were ordering regular daal and pulao. This place is done up very prettily, too, although in a bare-bones old-school Bengali way. There are pictures of Indian musical instruments and the tables are done up on Bengali "kantha" embroidery. The door connecting the place to the next property has the sort of "aalpona" one still sees in some areas of rural Bengal. Service is a bit laid-back, but despite their occasional incompetence, the people mean well. The only problem in this place is their awful bathroom. There's lots of space in front of the restaurant that lies unused, so there's really no excuse for making customers use the narrow, tiny, frequently-smelly, wet-floored little travesty squeezed in between the two kitchen-areas. I once had to use the loo before I ordered, and almost walked out without ordering anything because I couldn't bear the idea of eating food prepared in places next to that cracked-tiles, water-leaking, stained-toilet bowl room. Get on this problem, Bhojohori. Quick!|negative
Rated Pathetic rolls ...and insult to injury is long hair strand.puke. Am not an expert on bengali food but sweet wierd tasting rolls is by any palate not accepted.Have no idea abt authentic kathi rolls but if these are authentic then i swear by our very own tibbs frankie which beats them hands down on their bad day too. No second chance ..getting nausea while writing too...|negative
Rated The place us small. Music was majorly Bollywood. Starters were decent. Service is okay. Staff is a little confused. Overall okay for a one time visit. Wasn't crowded for a weekend when I went there.|negative
Rated No way - this place has bad sound. Bad service. Guests taken for granted. ... Just because we know the staff , does not qualify them to misbehave. We pay right. Ramesh the manager, have known him from many restaurants, , but sorry he does not know how to manage his staff. The bar tenders - an Oriya guy, I respect Odisha , because I have spent 25 formative years of my childhood there. Feel saddened that people from Odisha pick up an attitude and dont respect guests. I told the Bar tender - R. Mohapatro - please take care of the schemes ( you guys dont have time system, so its left upto whims and fancy of the people ) sadly he was so rude, I cannot believe. I told him not to be rude , he could lose his job. He just did not bother, his expression towards me was disgusting. I decided to leave the place instantly. Well, we pay and we leave and decide not to visit such places thanks to the management. Overall - Claustrophobic , average food. If you accept the staff attitude then be my my guest, that can be your dessert. Attitude from staff is free. Overall a bad experience the 3rd time - ( went so many times on a friends request) - Never again|negative
Rated So i went here today, for like evening snacks & was disgusted with the quality of the food they served! I even left a dish untouched after having a bite of it! Firstly, the place was super empty! We started of with ordering Nachos with Cheese Sauce, the nachos was super salty, and the cheese sauce was spoilt. Second i ordered a Basil & Chilli Panner, this was the only thing i liked! Was sweet but had a weird taste to the end so cant recommend this either! Lastly we ordered some Veg Crystal Dim Sums! Worst dimsum ever tasted in my life, it was partially over cooked, tasteless, after a bite i left this dish as it is! Also seems they were low on stock, i asked for a regular pepsi but all they had to offer was a Diet Pepsi. Lastly he got me the wrong bill, he forgot to add an item into it & instead of generating a new bill, just wrote it with pen on the bill below and asked us to pay the new amount! Service is fine, but food is a big thumbs down 👎�?� This place when it had opened up, had quite a charm to it, seems to have lost it now! Needs urgent quality control on what they serve! Felt sick after seeing those dim sums!|negative
Rated We were expecting to have a good time here so we bought a nearbuy deal for Loco chino.We went there and informed the manager Mr. Sanjay tamboli that we have a deal,he said they would require a hard copy of the voucher.We pointed out that a physical copy of the deal is not mandatory as stated by nearbuy and a voucher code should suffice.but he was adamant and seemed to have an attitude issue.He was being extremely rude. We finally managed to get a printout and hoped that the meal would make up for the bad experience.It started off well with the starters and momos. The lemongrass fish was reallly good to taste so was the dry red chilli chicken. We called for roasted chicken and basil & burnt garlic dimsums,the latter being tastier. We then ordered our WOKS,which are highly customizable right from base to sauce and toppings. I was shocked to see a strand of hair in my wok(pictures attached) .I immediately reported this to the manager who seemed very casual about the incident.He offered me a fresh wok made instead.after about 5 min,i found hair in my husband's wok as well!! i was totally disgusted by now and asked the manager to take everything away.There was no remorse whatsoever. He said he would be happy to offer us a complimentary wok in the future which we declined. The desserts came last,Churros and chocolate nachos which were ok.The Nachos seemed drenched in oil.. Overall a horrible experience as far as hygiene goes,topped with the rude and careless attitude of the manager.|negative
Rated Found the ambience too dark and dull. Menu is same, don't want to mention the dishes as it will match with my other reviews. Service here is slow. Parking available|negative
Rated Disappointed. Heard so much about you guys, and the Arabiata pasta was undercooked. Really?? How can you go wrong with the basis stuff...Never ordering again, and thanks to you guys I have a stomach ache...|negative
Rated Very disappointed, took over and hour to get a salad , ordered online , been enroute for 45 mins . Salad was tasteless . Even with the dressing . Deepesh Agarwal|negative
Rated Some one gifted me two pasta box from the popular "Italy in my Box". I had heard of this place so much that i was really craving to experience this place. I am really sorry to write harsh about a food joint, but i am equally disappointed with this place. I not a chef but as per my understanding Alfredo (white pasta sauce) should be creamy, cheesy, good fragrance of basil and lil garlic. what i received was dry, cheesless wired wild smell of provably oregano and rosemary. and complete tasteless. Infact because of that wild fragrance i couldn't eat it. I hate to disrespect food, but i had to. Somehow next day removed sauce and remake sauce and had to finish one, unfortunately had to throw the other one. Value for money:- No vegges, no olive, no cheese. Paying 200/- only for bow shaped pasta. Lil hi for my pocket. Packaging:- very good, innovate. Only point for that.|negative
Rated The place is quite small. We went for dine in and honestly the expectation were not met. Neither in terms of ambience nor the service. The place was surprisingly empty. Even the food was just okay. It was not bad but it was okay.|negative
Rated I seriously don't understand what the fuss is about. Any foodie with decent culinary experience in North India can debunk this place in a mo. Strictly average kebabs at almost 3-4 times their worth. The cost isn't offset by the dingy ambiance or the mediocre experience. Absolutely nothing justifies the sort of price they charge; in the 1.5 hrs I was there, not a single customer entered. The dining table was DUSTY. Food was very average. For the price charged, I feel almost cheated. I walked away a disappointed customer. To readers: while some may be fond of this place, do try other awesome places and judge for yourself.|negative
Rated I don't understand the big fuss over this place. I ordered kakori kebabs and warqi paratha- its was average. The taste was weird and it melted in the mouth. Maybe that's how kebabs are supposed to be. But I am not used to that. Even eating it was diffcult..mushy mushy weird. The paratha wsnt great either. And everything is expensive- 515 for a couple of kebab pieces and one measly paratha.|negative
Rated Ordered from here today- and earlier once. Today's was really horrible- cold, stale and weird tasting. The french fries were not well made and the sour cream with them was yuck. The chicken shwarma was stale and did not taste good (was too sour). The previous order was relatively better and tasted normal- indicating stale food and inconsistent quality.|negative
Rated This outlet seems to be racing for "to be the SLOWEST" outlet and with most lazy staff ever !!! The ambience is very good in winter time but the quantity of food served for the price charged is VERY POOR !!! The food taste average not that great|negative
Rated I ordered veg hummus salad. It was as expected, good. The reason for the low rating is that the falafel was cold and was fried long time back. The serving of the hummus was also poor, hence most of my pita was consumed dry. Having eaten at various outlets Maroosh,I found the salad could have been superb but have limited it to a good.|negative
Rated First of all , death by chocolate was awesome , I had that at many places but this was different . We ordered cheese garlic bread ( which was okayish) , then a cold coffee ( which lived upto my expectations). And other than food , you can play board games . and very slow and calming feeling when you have to relax after a long day|negative
Rated I have had Gyros from other Greek joints before but this one was by far the most average.. Veggies were stale and it was quite poorly spiced. They need to serious set up their game.|negative
Rated Ordered Fish platter which took 2 hrs to reach. Unfortunately the quality was pathetic sauces added with no proportion it tasted more like an failed attempt to make a fish platter|negative
Rated The gyros. I stopped eating shwarmas the day I had this. They're disgustingly delicious. You can barely hold one properly, let alone eat it. The amount of mayo they use makes it even more special. The baconator is yummy. Although sometimes a few bacon pieces are uncooked. That's a disappointment. But if you can overlook that this is one big meal. And it's cheap too|negative
Rated Poor unapologetic and rude customer service. They cannot process a simple toast sandwich order with special instructions. Food was OK and definitely overpriced.|negative
Rated Was in pali Naka the other day when the urge to have the thickest milk shake ever struck,and what do you know? crossed Gonuts and entered on a whim....and as usual ended up ordering for 3 milk shakes...ferraro rocher,cheesecake and strawberyy something... Oh my gosh...each sip from each shake was sooo ultra good,i was like those greedy children with three milkshakes taking a sip from each one turn by turn...i finished them all and still could not decide which tasted better...the chunks of strawberries...that cheesy taste...the pieces of ferraro....absolutely Yum!!|negative
Rated A small hangout place.. With some crazy soda flavours..like lagoonberry and buttermilk soda... Dont miss orangelagoon... And the pizzas here are yumm.. Much better than expected under 100 bucks.. And chats sandwiches , rolls are ok.. Try cold coco too!!|negative
Rated Open till 1am. Staff is always rushing to deliver the orders in the cars. Cheese chilli toast - yumm. Idlis served with chatni and podi. DSP - Must Have. Chocolate walnut fudge shake. Full of sinful calories. Hunger pangs post 12 , head your way here !|negative
Rated Situated at d junction of dadar tt circle is known for being open till late night (2:30 am). Is always crowded but d service is quick. Try d sitafal chocolate :)|negative
Rated Falooda point! The Falooda itself is bad what else can you expect over here then. The kufli's are just about okay. Nothing special over here.|negative
Rated sad in terms of hygiene n taste .seems the flood is prepared in water ..|negative
Rated Visiting this place is a must if you are an ice cream lover. They serve freshly made pan ice cream. Ferroro rocher pan sundae is personally my favourite.|negative
Rated I totally love the Paneer Cheese Grill that they offer but to tell you the truth. Ive had the worst experience during one order when they had to deliver it to my office. I had ordered a Paneer cheese grill n another sandwich at 10.30am but it hasnt reached till now i.e.12.30pm. They have the world's most stupidest excuses to explain their tardiness. I dont know how they expect me to eat my breakfst sandwich fr lunch. Hence my rating fr their delivery service is 1.5 out of 5.|negative
Rated Im a fan of fruits and fruit juices..so i gave it a try out here...they charge you crazie...and juice dey serve is so mixed with artificial colors and flavours...i could literally get the taste of chemicals in dem...very poor experience of HAS juices at viviana.|negative
Rated There are two stores connected to each other shreeji Just chill n Shreeji pizaass. We ordered Veg cheese pizza Large for Rs.150. After a long wait for 20-25mins what we got is third grade pizza. Some uncooked veges topped with raw cheese (grated cheese put after the pizza made i.e unmelted cheese) with some chaat masala or red chilly powder sprinkled over it. I make 10times far better pizzas at home with normal Veges n w/o microwave or oven. Even my hubby thought the same. we wasted our money n time.|negative
Rated A complete rip off of Boba tea or Pearls served in the asian countries. After my visit to Malaysia, which introduced me to chatime. I spent my days researching about any similar drinks in mumbai. Which then ended up in the discovery of Dr. bubbles. Enthusiastic, i hopped to this place. Which very high expectations. Since their bubbled matched alot with the Pearls usually served in the boba tea. I disappointed at the flavors served. Both for the tea and the bubbles. Firstly there need not be a particular flavor for the pearls, that will confuse the consumer. They might end up choosing the wrong combination, leading to a bad experience. Keep it generic and simple. Something which can go with any tea you serve. Even, MANGO :/! The bobas you eat out of india, do not, i repeat, DO NOT, Burst open in your mouth, leaving behind a squishy pulp and gel like thin layer of the burst bubble. The tasted absolutely sour and unpalatable. They use the right ingredient to make the bubbles just going wrong in the application. Sad, i left most of the tea behind. And continued my search for Pearl teas or Bobas around the city! :(|negative
Rated We didn't get a chance to dine in but the take away was quickly prepared and the food was amazing..their paprika chicken and chicken huanciana were amazing...would love to visit again|positive
Rated We decided to go to this place for lunch and it was the best decision. The place and staff are extremely welcoming and warm. The menu boasts of a lot of variety and you will want to try everything on it. 'Pollo Ala Huancaina' and 'Chicken Paprika' are a must try. The service is extremely quick and they make sure they give you the best suggestions. The 'Oreo Mango Shake' and the 'Mango Mojito' were extremely different and the best summer coolers. Highly recommended!|positive
Rated To begin with, the staff are extremely nice. We had to wait for a bit since this place is always crowded but it was worth the wait. They took our order while we were waiting so once we got our place we were served immediately. Cucumbis & Paprika chicken was simply splendid ! :D really good food & presentation. Variety of food options so you are not disappointed. Definitely going back again :)|positive
Rated First of all the most important point that i noticed about this place was that, the staff working at this place was very kind, and co-operative and friendly which is a very big deal according to me. The menu is unique and the place is too cool and attractive. I had a little argument with my girlfriend just before comming to TFK, so I had to decide what all to order. We ordered the pollo alla huancaiana, which is chicken with huancaiana sauce. It was very presentable and tasted soo good we forgot all the arguments we had a minute ago and just dug into it. Then we tried the chicken paprika which was the chef's recommendation. The mocktail for today was chilled mango mojito which was quite amazing. Over all an amazing place no doubt , must try it once, with friends or family or any1 or go alone, but GO. And the prices are quite reasonable too. (The best chicken ever; according to my girlfriend)|positive
Rated The best part of #TFK - Hospitality at its best!! Manager would come by ur table, suggest few dishes, even something off menu and will keep a check that order is served properly. Second to best is the setup and ambiance as the name says it is a fusion of cultures. Keep that aside the food dint win my heart.. House salad was too sour for my taste buds but Mango Mojito suggested by Harsh(Manager) & Chicken Tikka Nachos saved the evening for me. So thats a salad,couple of drinks and a starter for Rs. 860, I would say slightly over priced and worth a visit once in-couple of months. All-in-All good place to pass time with your buddies with great hospitality,some good drinks but average food. And yea how can I forget some tiny bits of pieces left on your table that are great conversation starters, so someone looking for their special date night, this is a good option!!|positive
Rated A Blend of Fine Food Taste, Ambience and great service. We were here on a Sunday evening and was packed so had to wait for 15 mins. We got a chance to sit in their new hotel opened which is adjacent. We ordered the following. Chicken tikka nachos: Okay.. Nothing Great for a nachos. Chicken roulade: This was good. Perfect flavor and cooked well. Chinese sizzler: This was good too. Quite filling Sizzler but the down side was it had too many veggies. Chicken paprika: I'm not a fan of continental dishes, but I must admit.. This dish was awesome. Oreo, candy man milkshake : They were the highlight of the dinner. Personally, I would prefer candy man. Buy both were awesome. Food 3.5/5 Ambience 4/5 Service 4.5/5 Value for money 3.5/5|positive
Rated Service at its best. Its a tiny cozy place in IC Colony. Tried this place for the first time. Though me and my friend were Vegetarian for the day, the service guy sorry, i dont remember his name took care about which dish would be preferable for two of us. He even made sure about the toppings we would like. We had Over Laden Nachos. Its their speciality. I would surely recommend this place. Will again visit TFK on our non veg days|positive
Rated Okay..lets start by saying that is was selected randomly checking its rating on zomato..the occasion being my Bestfriend's birthday... It was a hectic drive all the way from vasai to borivali....which m glad was well deserved... The manager knows his job quite very well and was impressed with the hospitality expressed...the interiors mattered as effort were taken to set the tone of the place right... The concept of fusion is well put and appreciate the witty menu... everything that was ordered felt like the best decision...and the prices are in ballpark... Only suggestion would be to innovate something original and new as the place has a unique indentity i feel and probably could experiment with meat... Thank for having us...|positive
Rated Food and service was veryy amazingg!! The attendants there always advice the best dishes! One must consider their advice and order! One must try Pineapple mojito and flower pot. Starters and chicken paparika are very tasty! One must go there as early as possible as there is always a big cue and a big waiting list! Food -4.5/5 Service -5/5 Ambience-4/5|positive
Rated This is one review for which i had to preserve the bill so that i don't forget the names of the dishes. On a hot sunday afternoon we visited this place tucked at the end of the I.C colony. Their two drinks machu pichu and virgin margarita black current certainly helped us to get refreshed and all charged up to indulge in the south american cuisine that is the speciality of the place. For starters we had fish fingers and pollo ala huancaina. Both were good. If you donot try their fish fingers then you are definitely missing something awesome. As suggested by the management, we had chicken paprika for main course. It is their speciality and rightly so. The spices were just about perfect. We ended our meal with another of their suggestion, choco biscuit wagon which is a delite to any dessert lover. Prices are reasonble. The place is a bit small but cool. The staff is very helpful and greets with a smile. Lovely experience.|positive
Rated Places like these are very hard to review. They have a good fan base and even the food seems alright due to great preparation ethics, but when the people do blunder the experience for me indeed is not satisfactory. I went there one evening for dinner and was amazed by the setup they have. They have both outdoor and indoor dining with great seating and equally pleasing decor. The ambiance on a whole is very decent and sophisticated but due to its immense popularity, it is always crowded and thus it becomes a very loud place. In all the place is a total eye candy with brightly lit environment and great work on roofs and walls. Bar section is also a delight to watch. Staff is good and will guide you best for your order. Though I am not very pleased with the staff inside the kitchen. I started with their recommended cocktail which was not on the menu. They don't even have a name for it but it was a tangy one with orange and grapefruit in it with Rum base. It was very refreshing indeed and very good in terms of mixology. In starters I went with their recommended of Chicken Pahadi Kebab which again was not in the menu. It arrived after considerable delay and sadly was not worth the wait. The marinade and seasonings were really good but the meat was undercooked from the insides which was a big letdown. Considering it was just chicken which does not take much time, that was totally a disappointment. In mains I went with veg patty sizzler in hot garlic sauce on noodles with sauteed mushrooms and tortilla chips. It again took time bit sadly what arrived to me was rice instead of noodles and fries instead of tortillas, Though they arranged me noodles soon after but even with that it was not much pleasing. The sauce was good but considerably less in quantity and the vegetable pattice could have been better. In all the place is very good in terms of its decor, but the carelessness of kitchen staff was an issue. The preparation and recipes were good which I felt from everything I had here but the execution is doing no justice to it. Order takes time but that too is understandable considering the number of people dining in this restaurant all the time. Prices are reasonable and you won't find anything in menu overpriced. My Rating: 1. Food: 3/5 2. Service: 3/5 3. Ambiance: 4/5 4. Value of Money: 4/5 neverknowsbest.in|positive
Rated Yest visited place 2nd time with friends. Food,music,ambiance, variety of food everything is good. But little complaint about delay in service. If the service was quick i would have given 4 rating. Kindly improve on service guys rest things are good. Keep it up. Looking forward. Thanks|positive
Rated Nice place in to be with family ,ambience is good ,we ordered for brocolli and cheddar soup not upto the mark it was too thick,then ordered for chicken shashlik sizzler and paneer shashlik sizzler along with prawns sizzler all three were ok the chicken was better than the two we had lemonade and ginger pitcher overall nice place and the service is also ok|positive

Must try out diz plc!!|positive
Rated It's a very nice place in Mulund for hangout with friends. It's very nice place for alcohol lovers with nice booze and good food. The thing disappointed me most was lighting. Lights are very loud as per the ambience. It could be little bit dim to match the ambience.|positive
Rated I came here on a birthday with my best friend and we had a lovely time! The place was packed - it's really popular given that Mulund is starved of good restaurants. I was impressed by the space and the swanky decor. The food was quite brilliant and so were the drinks. When the servers found out it was my birthday, they got us free dessert! Thanks for that. The only negative is that the music is really loud. trailstainedfingers.com|positive
Rated The food studio!! One of the good places in mulund. Nice ambience, loud music but average food. We tried cajun fried chicken, channa chat, veg balls in soya garlic sauce n grillee chicken sizzler in peri peri sauce. Quick service n really good staff management.|positive
Rated Had a pleasant experience while dining with my family. We ordered the specialities of the place. In soups, the lemon chilli coriander superseded the broccoli and cheddar soup. In appetizers, I would suggest Cheese Chilli Toast, Crackling Spinach With Paneer, Veg Balls in Garlic Soy Sauce,Mexican Garlic Bread. Few of dishes were a bit cold but nevertheless had their taste and flavor. To complete the dinner a fine paneer sizzler, which served the purpose. Sitting in the interior room, the ambience was well suited for a family dinner. I would definitely visit the place again. A piece of advice would be change of music choice,also a little bit better lighting in the interior area where i was seated with my family.|positive
Rated Ambience : Great Food: Good Service: Great Music: Great If your a resident of Mulund then this a very good place to visit|positive
Rated Cute and cozy place. Go with friends who will hog with you. The pizzas are a must try, they are really tasty (chicken tikka pizza is recommended) the canopy also was also great,I also had the Oreo cheese cake and tiramisu which were jus yummm|positive
Rated Wanted to try ths place since quite a while.. it's damn close to one of my fav place in dadar named ovenfresh... Finally visited ths place 2dae.. tried their italiano pizza n must say it was amazing.. they have a grt variety in their cake studio as well and serve quite a variety of mountails n shakes as well.. worth visiting|positive
Rated You get a goody goody feeling ever tym you step in ! Tapping music, lip smacking food, decent ambience and courteous staff! No negative points till now. P.S : 0.5 deducted so they keep going better and better!|positive
Rated Just the name suggest, its like home made typical Mumbai food, Nice ambiance, great food. Highly recommended place to go. Try the past & masala omelette.|positive
Rated Aftr hearing abt dis restaurant so mch...finally gt tym 2 gt here. As I was around shiva ji park area..famous 4 itz cake studio..itz equally good 4 itz food menu! Service is good...so is d ambience! I I personally liked oriental fries..cheese corn ball wid sweetchili sauce..desi veg pizza n oreo shake|positive
Rated This is our most visited joint. It gives a very warm feeling. The staff here is very helpful and rake good care of you. The Tuesday and Thursday offer is godsent. We again visited this olace yesterday. Yesterday's offer was buy one oizza and get another free. Their portion are good too and quiet filling. They have some amazing deserts especially their pastries. Thwir vanilla milkshake and freshlime water are simply amazing|positive
Rated Home Chef is kind of place where one can go comfortably with both friends & family. Food is really nice. Iced tea & the other drink were huge in quantity. Penne Pesto was very nicely done. Croquettes & it's accompaniment were yumm. Coconut prawns curry was perfectly flavoured. I personally don't like lasagna which was OK. Frequented by families & college students around. The 1st floor seems a bit cramped but it could be good if one goes along with a group. Their cake shop is merged in this restaurant. Music is played throughout. The only thing below average at this place is their service. We had to loudly call out the service staff for basic things like refilling water glass. Moreover this place could be hard to find even when you walk past the same lane because there is very less visible branding outside. Home Chef is recommended !!|positive
Rated While Mumbai has an abundance of places that serve the so called 'Continental' cuisine, this place has been an old favorite of many. My visit here totally confirmed why people have been coming here. There is a certain approachability to the place which sometimes other places miss big time. This lends itself to the whole experience wonderfully. We had some fish fingers and lime grilled chicken. Both the dishes were very good and the serving size was also nice. The fish fingers were classically done and who wouldn't want that. The grilled chicken was especially nice with the chicken very juicy and the skin super crispy. Overall it was a good experience and I would recommend this place.|positive
Rated A small place and you might just miss while passing by but since this was on my list since a long time, I decided to go to Home Chef for a quick lunch. The ambiance is perfect for an outing where in you just want to sit and talk and relax without all the usual noise and disturbances .This place is cozy and nice. The interiors are simple and classy. We were promptly seated and did not have to wait at all. We started our meal with Cheesy Pesto Samosas, these were sort of Italian samosas served with a sweet chilli dip, but the stuffing inside tasted delicious even without the dip. Then we ordered Sweet Chilli Butterfly Prawns, this was served on a sizzler plate and the prawns were well marinated in a sweet and chilli mix, this is a must try for all seafood lovers. For the mains we ordered the Veg Lasagna which was average as it was cooked in red sauce and was less spicy. The Veg Mexicano Sizzler was Mexican rice topped with vegetables, cheese corn balls and melted cheese which made it delicious. We also tried the Surf and Turf which was absolutely fabulous, it was a combination of Chicken and Fish consisting of grilled chicken breasts in a pepper sauce with rice, pieces of fried prawns on a bed of corn, mashed potatoes and chicken frank. This was delicious and a must try for all non-vegetarians. We also tried the Shake-a-cake which was a Black Forest milkshake and a chocolate pastry to go along with this. This place is not very heavy on the pocket also their menu has a lot of things to try. Will surely visit again to try more things from here.|positive
Rated So my first visit to a Chilie's in Mumbai. I have been their outlets in both Delhi and Bangalore. The food was good and the beer was chilled. But the service disappointed me. My service seemed a bit cold. When you are serving someone you need to put your heart into it. Initially I had to wait for 10 min for someone to take the order., and then another 15 min before my server told me that if would take my beer in a smaller glass as they didn't have enough pilsners. Since I was hungry and thirsty I said yes but guys you should definitely stock up on glasses and get some more staff. As far as food goes I had a molten cheese steak which was good but I would say I have had better.|positive
Rated Low rating because seating is random: this fellow doing seating asked us to wait for 20 mind. After that when we checked, this other waiter told us we could take any empty table: and there were quite a few. Very random. Their margarita s are the best! I also like their starters usually but not this time: the nachos looked nothing like the description and we're burnt.|positive
Rated Ambience good !! Food good !! Quantity ok ok !! It's has very young peppy atmosphere, has a nice Mexican American menu. Food is nice a lil on expensive side. Overall you can have nice time !|positive
Rated The quesadillas and tacos are worth it. They're worth the hype and the price. Chicken quesadillas are the best. The triple dipper veg is a nice option to go to for a quick tummy filling meal. Just that, the cheese poppers are too oily. More than two just can't be eaten. The pasta is out of the world. Perfect amount of sauce, perfect amount of veggies too. It's a little over priced but it lives up to the Mexican food expectations. I've visited this place so many times and still will. It's my personal Mexican food favourite. I'd rate it 2.5/5 cause, what disappointed me was the staff wasn't very friendly. It was 1.20 am agreed, but no other tables were asked to hurry up when they were eating. A restaurant is supposed to wait until the customers finish their meal however late is, as manners. We hadn't even finished our meal and drinks but we were asked to hurry up to leave almost thrice. That's the only reason that might stop me from visiting here again. These are basic etiquettes which a restaurant should follow and Chili's failed.|positive
Rated Ambience and service is good. But I find this place too expensive for the quantity they serve. I ordered nachos and I was literally served 6 nachos for 325 Rs like are you kidding me?? First time I went to this place and ordered nachos the quantity was good like a huge place full of it. To next time I got served 6 nachos in the same price. This was after they renovated the place. I have also tried the 5 dip platter in which there were 3 veg and 2 non veg dishes. Veg dishes were good. Chicken wings were so pathetic they were pakoras and not wings. The dips were okay nothing great. However I do like their cocktails specially cosmopolitan and beerita but I would only have those in happy hours.|positive
Rated I have been here twice. Since it is know for American food, the extra deep fried food was no surprise The veg food here was much better than the non veg. Ordered onion rings and cheese poppers and couple of other dishes. All were good The non veg items we ordered were really bad and lacked flavour or had totally unwanted flavours We ordered an ultimate dipper -2 of the chicken dishes were inedible. For some reason, someone thought that making chicken taste like mango pickle was a good idea. None of us liked it- not sure if otherwise it is a popular dish Then we went for Buffalo & Chicken burgers- this was average. Though the falvours were there, the patty was not juicy and is not in line with the typical American Burger. Finally the pitcher of beer we ordered- It was flat. The first time I had come here, had ordered a Mug and it was really crisp. This time the pitchers we ordered were flat and was like drinking flavored water Music - not sure if they played any- either i couldnt hear it or it was not memorable Service - Nothing great nor nothing bad Ambiance - its bright and lively- some of the sections could use better chairs Price - it came to around 1000 per head - we did not enjoy the food, the drinks, the ambiance nor the music - so I would say it is over priced Will I visit again - not sure - Can give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they have better dishes in the menu|positive
Rated Nice American joint in Powai ... Open till late at night... This place is usually filled with youngsters from offices nearby and college students... Nice bar and good food menu... Jalapeño poppers were nice,,, veg platter was also nice... They had big screen to watch ipl matches.... Nice ambience and good crowd...|positive
Rated When life gives you lemons, you catch them all and put them in a cocktail. Just in case you guys missed it, that's not what the saying really is but that's the version I follow and thanks to Chili's, I have never been disappointed. This outlet just lightens you up with its ambience. It has the vibe of a really vibrant diner having a bar along with certain quips of its history on the walls. Be prepared for some great music and chattering crowds that just adds a lot to the warmth of the place. The service needs some work because I've had to wave my arms like a loon to catch the attention of the staff, to waiting for eternity for my order to even repeat my order a few times because it was forgotten. Also, the typical waiting period during the rush hours is 45 minutes, so plan accordingly. Now the food and boy, oh boy the food!! The menu is pretty extensive but falters like a broken car on a lonely highway for veggies, like me. Honestly speaking, I am not very disappointed by it but would love to see if the guys here can do something more. I have had the classic nachos which made me bow down and say hallelujah. The dish is well presented and the flavors will come dancing on your tongue. I also had the fried pickles which were quite relishing. The batter itself was delicious and really crunchy combined with the savory pickles, made the dish a really good muncher. Last but not the least, comes the jalapeño paneer quesedillas which were pretty impressive but the paneer felt rather chewy. The drinks menu is pretty extensive too, out of which the long Island iced tea is my absolute favourite. The place may seem a little heavy on the pocket but the combination of the portion size with the atmosphere makes it all worth every penny. All in all, this is the place to sit back, relax and chatter with your friends; while sipping on a drink and munching on their food.|positive
Rated I have been here twice and just love the ambience they have. The menu is very interesting however couldnt try much yet. Food is good only concern is the quantity. Service is also good. Best place to hang out with friends and catch up on few drinks.|positive
Rated This is one of the most amazing places in the entire city. Food, ambience, service, quality, you name it and it's extraordinary. I hadn't known this place before so my expectations weren't too high, but the overall experience just swept me off my feet. The food here is impressive; not just delicious, since you get delicious food at quite a few places, but here it was truly impressive. The service was perfect, as if the staff knew how frequently to visit a table without interrupting the privacy. Their awareness towards the customers was impeccable no matter how crowded the place got. The ambience is soothingly dim which can be suitable for any type of visit. The place is highly recommended and I look forward to visit it again as soon as I get an opportunity.|positive
Rated Went on Sunday around 8-8:15. The place was less crowded. We ordered the mushroom tart. One was the best tarts every had! So soft ad delicious!! In all the food was absolutely yummy and delicious!! The ambience will well designed too A great place to visit with friends and enjoy the music and the surrounding|positive
Rated Amazing place! Food is too good at Cafe Zoe- went there on Sunday afternoon had couple buckets of beers along with basa dish, Ravas butter thing, chicken meatballs spaghetti, roast chicken and tiramisu cake, Walnut cake for desert! (Don't remember the exact names of dishes) Everything was good plus...|positive
Rated Had a rack or ribs, expected a lot and was over delivered... Not just the texture, flavour, sleep and presentation that was top notch, surprisingly the quantity was double what I had anticipated... Freaked me out as places like this (bloody expensive) usually give such small portions I am forced to order twice... Lovely weekday visit but not so much fun on the weekend as the last few times I've been there it's simply over crowded... But I will be back, have to pay my respects to the goodies in the display at the entrance...|positive
Rated Took my team out for lunch & this place turned out perfect. 5 stars as far as the ambience & decor is concerned. Very young, vibrant & peppy. However, the food palette needs improvement. Though they have some exotic ones like the mini lamb burgers & the basa fillet, the overall food experience could not live up to my expectations. The ravioli & Penne mushroom ragout need more imagination.. To summarise, the menu is innovative but lacks imagination. Good for the belly, not for the heart!|positive
Rated This is a definite regular on my list, both for brunches and for nights out. The food is always good, not spectacular. The few things that stand out in my mind the shredded tenderloin parpadelle, the prawn & squid ajillo and this brunch egg dish with poached eggs and garlicy yoghurt. The salads are always tasty but I wish the portions were bigger The fresh juices are always good. The one thing I love about Zoe is the vibe. The open space is great for any time of day or night. I love their retro nights in Saturday's when everything is bustling and happy and the music is super. I would recommend Zoe for almost any occasion, if you want decent food and a great vibe.|positive
Rated Beef sliders need I say more? Love the ambience in here! It's mostly young office goers having lunch whilst having fun. I've had quite a few drinks on the menu. They've all been good. And I'd like to try more so you know I'd visit this place again.|positive
Rated An absolute jewel! You know what? I want more of these places! More! Because this place gobsmackingly amazing! Once you enter, you'll be in a whole new world, one that you'd never wish to leave. And we'd gone just for breakfast! Service: It's not lazy, just laid back. Not something that bothered me, because you're equally if not more laid back here. They're quite gracious in their demeanour, and pleasing overall. Good service helps a lot, and this place is a testament. Ambience & cor: I shall first attempt to describe the dcor, because that greatly influences the ambience. Really big place, high ceiling, seating spread far across, plants, big bar in the centre, vibrant colours, bright lights, good furniture. Now those are all brilliant things. Ambience is magnificent because of such features. You can talk without feeling disturbed, and totally enjoy this place. Love it! Food: We ordered stuff off the breakfast menu. BREAKFAST MUSHROOM TOAST. The mushrooms were amazing! Mind blowing stuff! There was a slight hint of parsley and basil, perhaps even some pesto in there. The bread was great too! Crisp and fresh! The side salad was pretty decent. If you like mushrooms even a little, you'll love this! EGGS BENEDICT. There are 4 elements here. Firstly, the slice of cheese. It wasn't just placed, it was melted on top. It was a part of the dish. Tasted brilliant. Secondly, the eggs themselves were cooked to perfection. And the yolk oozed out passionately. Thirdly, Norwegian Salmon. Oh my god! It's like falling in love with fish all over again. Perfect. And lastly, the bread. The element that is easy to overlook. But it was crucial for it to be good. PANCAKES along with MAPLE SYRUP, CHOCOLATE SAUCE AND WHIPPED CREAM. First and foremost, the pancake batter was heavy in its eggs. But apart from that, I couldn't find another flaw. Everything was just as desired. We had two fresh juices. SWEET LIME and WATERMELON. Now, you could taste that they fresh and real. There was no added sugar, and it was certainly not preserved. Natural as it was, there wasn't anything amazing about it. But that didn't bother me one bit, because I know the value of Fresh Fruit Juices. (I could star in a commercial of the same) I'll be honest, it surpassed my expectations. And I was left very satisfied. Something still seems amiss. If there were a million things that Zoe provides, then there's at least one thing that it doesn't. What is that one thing? Finesse of the highest order. And how do they achieve said finesse? I have no clue, which is why, I still find it one of the greatest places that I've visited.|positive
Rated One of the most beautiful indoor settings I have seen ever. The entrance doesn't give a sense of how huge the place is. As soon as I entered, I was wowed by the relaxed ambience and the spaciousness. Had a lovely breakfast with Aditi Olemann - egg Benedict, bacon and some tea (probably Jasmine). 5 stars for the ambience. The service could be slightly faster, though.|positive
Rated Nischita is a place in borivli well known for its non veg Indian and Chinese dishes.. Tried chicken crispy and chicken biryani from here.. Crispy felt little bland but biryani was tasty.. Space and ambience here is OK.. Overall could be tried for non veg dishes at reasonable rate.|positive
Rated Average place, I'd rather order food home than eat here. Not the most hygienic.. Food is average at best. Their birayani used to be good and had me hooked on but if late is become very dry and the rice undercooked. Wish they improved but they seem to be going the opposite direction|positive
Rated This place is one of the best if you like butter chicken mutton kheema and tandoori chicken. Hidden in northern mumbai's small suburb this place is a small shade. Attracts mostly young meat lovers. Menu is very simple and food served here packs a great punch with perfect blend of spices resulting in mouth watering dishes. N yes, it doesn't leave a crater in your pocket either. Must go.|positive
Rated Good food. A takeaway is highly recommended as the place is often packed. Try any of their Indian and tandoor dishes instead of the Chinese fare.|positive
Rated The place might not be that happening the food is just too good.....the chicken tikka was fab and have tried the chicken chilly indian style just too good with tandoori roti......tawa rice was average.....just near and good way to remove your hunger.....the home delivery is super fast and quantity just good for two people!!|positive
Rated Ordered full Chicken Tandoori from this place for first time was not disappointed at all. Taste was awesome. Less oily. Amazing place to order food rather than eating over there.|positive
Rated Food is amazing! It is best to get a home delivery done from here as the restaurant looks a little shady. The tandoori chicken, chicken tikka is beyond amaZing ! The chicken biryani and chicken curry is great too. A must visit for foodies :)|positive
Rated Simply good food! Mouthwatering, budget friendly, quick bites, quick service. Im a fan already. Tasty butter chicken, egg curry, chicken tawa rice and protein chicken. The food makes up for lack of ambience. :)|positive
Rated Well by the look of it you may think that its some cheap Chinese joint where people have drinks behind the curtains and all but that's not the case. You've got nice variety of food. Tandoor and Chinese. We had chicken crispy and Chicken Thai pot rice. Crispy was good not too spicy not too sweet and not too oily. In case of Thai pot rice, to my surprise it was better than what i was expecting from a place like this. It sorta lacked gravy they basically cooked rice in the gravy hence it soaked all of it, at other places you'd get gravy poured on white rice. It was certainly good and quantity was also good. (Chicken Crispy and Thai pot rice is good enough for 3 people, proper tummy full) Service was also good. Staff is courteous. Only thing is they take away the bill once you pay the amount (something that many restaurants in city do, make sure you always ask for a bill)|positive
Rated I've mostly ordered take out. So I'll just comment about the food. I found it tasty and very rich in texture. A value for money this place is. Their biryani and butter chicken is the more popular amongst the rest of dishes served here.|positive
Rated I was fancying a three tire dark chocolate yet sugarfree cake for my birthday this year. Less sinful and rarely available (especially in Mulund), fortunately I was introduced to Le Maison Patisserie. Extremely polite, patient and an honest entrepreneur. The cake looked gorgeous and sooooo delicious that it could just melt in your mouth !!! My family and friends couldn't stop raving about the cake yet. Been obsessed with this place ever since.. Also The Triple layer chocolate mousse cake is an absolute must try !!! Thankyou Le Maison Patisserie! *both thumbs up*|positive
Rated Talk about a real out of the world experience then you have to have a bit of soul pleasing delight at "the bakery name". The first thing that attracts you is the design of the cakes. So much attention to even the minutest of detail is really amazing. And then you have that spell bounding taste. An experinece that makes you come back for more. A real treat for all your senses keep up the good work loads of luv and god bless....|positive
Rated Gorgeous looking cakes which are also a treat to our tummies everytime. ....premium ingredients guaranteed resulting in mind blowing taste....btw they also make some unbelievable sugar free cakes for our guilt free pleasures...do check it out!!|positive
Rated I have had a chance to try the cakes a couple of times and I have never been disappointed. The menu includes a wide variety of flavours which I have rarely seen in other cake shops. I would recommend le maison any day over the commercial cakes with sugary chewy fondant!|positive
Rated Amazing cakes, very beautiful and creative. Has an amazing variety. The cupcakes are amazing too. Waffles are a must try. The chef is very friendly and believes in 100% customer satisfaction|positive
Rated This place will have one of the topmost spots in my heart always! It used to be our favourite haunts back in college times! We all stayed so close to shivaji park and would inadvertently head here for a dinner. There's nothing here that I don't like! It's a pure veg place now but we have been visiting it from the time it even served non veg. (Thou I'm not complaining since I'm a vegetarian!) You can order almost anything blindly and rest assured it will be good! I love their bruschetta, nachos, enchiladas and cream of brocolli soup! I especially love their woks that are customisable according to your choice of sauces! They serve it piping hot on a burner! Must must mention is their bakery! It's the best! Better than any other bakery ever! This used to be our place to order cakes from at each and every birthday of anyone in the group! Now that I remembered this, time to go back to ovenfresh for cakes again! The only downside is that this place will most certainly have waiting for dinners. We never minded waiting back then but now I prefer reservations! Call and check if they would reserve! It's an absolute delight to visit at any time and not be disappointed!|positive
Rated Finally could make my �?� fall into OvenFresh which is just next door for me. And believe me getting seat in 5 mins on Friday evening was like a victory. I have been there so many time but couldn't go beyond their bakery items which are so so yummy and tempting. So this time i tried their dough pizza and cheese corn balls.. Cheese corn balls were very much tasty.. Though it was an Over balls (6 pcs.) but it totally satisfied my taste buds and Pizza was good too. For making a pizza u have to choose the toppings (they charge extra for each topping) on ur own so make sure u arrange it right way coz their staff not gonna help us. As far as damages r concerned.. I find it bit costly.. For those 2 stuff total damages were Rs. 634/-|positive
Rated You are greeted with the aroma of fresh bakery products as soon as you enter. Ambience is simple yet elegant. Comfortable sitting, though the tables are all in a row and slightly close to each other. Service is very good, extremely friendly and polite staff. FOOD. Simply too good. Spinach and cheese Sandwich, paneer pizza, coffee...everything that we ordered was delicious. I saw a few people ordering nachos and it looked so yummy that I was tempted to order one myself. Heavenly indeed! Fully loaded with cheese, one of the best nachos i have ever had. Equally delicious are their desserts, chocolate muffins are to die for! Must visit if you are at dadar area.|positive
Rated A stunning place for those who eat vegetarian food. It has adapted very well to the changing times by incorporating newer dishes into its menu. The only pitfalls being a queue to get in, and a small seating area, it's otherwise a very nice place, and I seldom say that about pure vegetarian places. Service: Honestly, a little disappointed. There were instances wherein our patience was tested. But no major flaws. Since we arrive early, and there were several patrons waiting to be seated, the waiters were eager to get us out. A little hurried, no more. Ambience & Décor: Again, a small place. A little congested, but not claustrophobic, at least not for me. So it can be a little noisy. The décor on the other hand, is pretty good. Definitely impressive. It shows they've put thought into it. Food: I must say, I wasn't hungry when I arrived hence we didn't particularly feast on the dishes. NACHOS, this is my personal favourite here, and I've always had it each time I visit Ovenfresh. It's simple. Crisp and thin tortilla chips, with stringy, thick and delicious cheese sauce topped with some sliced capsicums. Great stuff. SMOKED CHIPOTLE HUMMUS WITH CIABATTA BREAD. Firstly, the hummus, was perfect in its texture. The chipotle flavour wasn't very noticeable, but the paprika and smoked flavours were. The oil too, was chilly oil. The bread, oh my God! Who would've thought that bread could be this good? Magnificent! SOBA NOODLES WITH TOFU AND VEGETABLES. Actually it was really nice, but we weren't particularly hungry, hence it wasn't very appetising. But frankly, it was a creative and somewhat healthy dish. If you like noodles, this isn't a bad pick. Two drinks: LIME AND MINT COOLER. Highly flavourful. In fact, too much. I added some water to dilute it. HAZELNUT CHOCOLATE SMOOTHIE. Good lord, wasn't that amazing? I could've drank litres of it. Thick and rich. So, Ovenfresh is a great vegetarian place. Sadly, they're restricted by space and deal with impatient and famished customers. If you get to visit this place, off peak hours then you are in for a delight.|positive
Rated One of the best Vegetarian joint which is unbeatable, I just love the food and the service here is also amazing. A visit for repetitive visits is Highly recommended. Disclaimer: Try not to visit on Weekends as its full packed and waiting might irritate you to the core. I recommend, 1. Cheese corn balls, 2. Cheese garlic bread, 3. Grilled cottage cheese with Chipotle, 4. Nachos, 5. Paneer Shashlik Sizzler.|positive
Rated Been close to my heart. This place has given me many memories. Love the sundries focaccia. love the bakery section for home shopping. Love most of the desserts they yummmm. N food has been good since always.|positive
Rated Amazing place.. yummy sizzlers and too good desserts.. they luckily have grt choices in eggless desserts also which is rare nw a days..one of my favorite place in dadar|positive
Rated Another one of my old favorite places to eat. Dining here was almost a weekly thing while in college. A big fan of their Swiss cheese fondue and cheesy garlic breads. Nachos with beans and corn cheese balls are also superb. They make awesome hummus as well. Almost always nail the risotto which I think is one of the most difficult thing to cook to perfection. Very decent pizzas as well. Lime and mint cooler is pretty refreshing and their thick cold coffee is superb. I just wish getting a table was a bit easier. There's almost always a wait time of at least 15 minutes, but it's worth the wait. :)|positive
Rated Been here today...and called for take away chicken biryani...The quantity was quite good but biryani was not upto the mark. First of all rice was not Basmati rice. Secondly it was little uncooked...third biryani doesn't have distinguish taste.. so it was wrong choice to order biryani here.... But i will love to try another food items soon.....|positive
Rated Burger king have always been among my favourite burger destination. Dadar star mall outlet was the 1 I was waiting for to get started. Buh however the counter people are not good at their service as they din not inform us abt the offer of 1 pe 1 free that was going on.|positive
Rated Very small take away place at Shivaji Park... Very few people know the address but every one knows the Name of it... Burger Corner! Please dont go by the name it doesn't serve only Burgers It has got variety of ready to eat starters. Mostly pre packed. Burger Corners Biryani is Hitt! Most importantly u dont have to order in kgs. U can order 250 gms 500gms however u wish. They really make good biryanis. Unlike other take away places they keep marinated Lollypops which u can fry at home and enjoy it piping hot! Their Burger is good not great anyways u have got many places to have Burger but Snacks specially Non Vegetarian no one can beat Burger King.|positive
Rated I fondly remember its aromatic mouthwatering chicken dum biryani. The deep fried caramelised onions on the top. The amazingly marinated potatoes in between. But sadly lost our those childhood days. The biryani is strictly ok now with no real 'dum' in it. The chicken seekh kebab with mint and onion chutney and chicken cutlets are decent. Wish they could bring back those flavours from good old days!|positive
Rated I have never had a burger from this joint surprisingly. I do intend to try soon. What we have been ordering from this place since my childhood is their biryani. It is a wonderfully spiced, fragrant Maharashtrian fare topped with deep fried onions. It has its own distinct flavour which which makes you their regular patron. I like the biryani here better than all the other joints in Mahim. It is non-oily yet moist enough due to adequate masala. The biryanis from other places in the vicinity Khans,Paramount,even Delhi Darbar leave me with sore throat the next day. Maybe its the dalda or the kind of oil they use. Preferred by many people I know in the vicinity. Definitely recommended for a takeaway. One might have trouble locating it though. Do pick up his Kheema patties and lollypops, they are delicious too.|positive
Rated This place us actually known for wide range of frozen meat and poultry items. They can fry and serve you most of the frozen snacks they have. They make a decent burger from one of their chicken patties.they serve it hot and fresh and the white sauce in the burger is good too. Nothing special but taste and quality is decent and worth trying once.|positive
Rated The biryani take away place for people living in the Dadar Shivaji Park area. A very small take away place located in a narrow lane close to Shivaji Park, Burger Corner can be very hard to find if you are new to the area. I'm a fan of their Chicken Biryani and the Chicken Lollipops. End up ordering from here once a month for a nice Sunday lunch with the family. You can try the Kheema Pattice too, which is also really good. The biryanis are reasonably priced and made in a very homely Maharashtrian style. Like the lollipops so much that I once ended up ordering 8 dozen to be shared among 8 people. :) Rajasi Patil Arya Patil|positive
Rated we are trying to reach on the contact numbers provided but none of them are available. the food quality is good but the policy of minimum order of 90 rs is not acceptable|positive
Rated I just ordered Shezwan Paneer Noodles & Tawa Pulav......... It took 50 min to get the parcel........ Food taste was very average....... I did not like the taste at all......|positive
Rated Tried out a new outlet opened in mulund west..an all veg cafe but great offerings.the wraps are unconventionally great and decently priced with a voluptious serving of their signature chilli mayo. other must try here is their chinese menu. they serve delectable chinese and have a great quantity to offer in terms of their pricing and the preparation also goes down well with me.the cafe made fresh schzwan chutney is an add on of their quality of food and great taste! also, pav bhaji and tawa pulav are light,tasty and pampering for your taste buds. wished this would be situated somewhere near chembur. way to go fresco!|positive
Rated Found an option for between meal hunger strikes! As the place is in my vicinity have tried various snacks from here.. They even serve variety of detox juices which are a delight for health freakers! Have always experienced quick & fast home delivery (approx.20 mins) for quick satisfaction of hunger between-meals! Food quality is good.. Loved their noodle wrap which i usually dont prefer elsewhere. They always provide complimentary mayonese sachets which is quite impressive, specially for a Mayo-Lover �? !!|positive
Rated A new café at one end of mulund west and I dragged my friends to this new place! Found the seating arrangement outdoor-ish (loved it!). For a new start up in Mulund, the service was good. We ordered a Latte, which tasted not so bad. Since we turned up at the time when Chinese wasn't served (no Chinese between 3-6pm), we tried the wraps and Frankie. While the schezwan wrap lacked the taste of schezwan sauce, the veg Frankie turned out to be alright. Me and my friends though loved one thing which was the mayo, given as a compliment to the wraps/frankies. Overall experience was good, the beverages- decently priced. If the place had some light music on, in the evening with the lights and a slight improvement in the quality of the food, the place could be turned to an amazing place!|positive
Rated I happened to accidentally visit the place. This is a small cafe but the foood is really amazing. Places like these need to be visited often. Definitely visiting again|positive
Rated This place is the best. Wenevr we visit ic colony this is our adda usually the owners are so sweet the staff is so polite food is amazing and at a very reasonable rate. The mojito the sandwiches lip smacking. How time passes by we don't even realise. Will recommend to everyone if u want to have a good time with ur friends this place is the right choice. Would rate it 4 if just the owners suggest to give it a thought to arrange a fan outside for people who sit out as in summers it gets really hot......|positive
Rated Blue Bliss gives u personal attention from the time u enter the Café! Great place to feel HOME AWAY FROM HOME!!! Great food and music giving u all the BLISS!|positive
Rated This lovely little joint is hidden away in a corner of IC colony and I happened to discover it by chance....and I'm so happy I did. It's quiet and cozy, has a lot of regulars visiting and the food is delicious. The owners are very polite and welcoming and they are very passionate about what they do. Always feels good to see them put in an honest effort to make customers smile and provide yummy food. Big thumbs up.... Would definitely recommend a visit.|positive
Rated A small but cute cafe in ic colony..good place to enjoy with a small group of friends. Delicious options of food and does not disappoint. Had the mushroom pasta in creamy sauce, potato chilli bites ( crunchy) , chicken wrap, paneer wrap, garlic bread with cheese and virgin mojito.. all of these were really good. For the veg lovers, paneer wrap is a must have. All in all had a really good and relaxing time here. Can't wait to try the breakfast menu ☺|positive
Rated A cozy cafe in the heart of IC colony. Their USP is the very existence. Chic interior, super friendly couple runs it and the food is just AMAZING. The pricing is just set right for one to become a regular with all these benefits combined. 😊|positive
Rated A small cafe joint hidden near YMCA Ic colony serving delicious food and beverages. Tried the cold coffee and the paneer wrap here, it was very well made and was filling. They have place to sit and the ambience is quite silent for a perfect date. The owner is also very friendly and helps you with the order.|positive
Rated I've been to this place about 6-7 times and each time i go it just gets better and better! This is a very cute little place tucked in by lanes of IC colony and is a refreshing change from stereotypical cafés! The owners here prepare the food themselves so you can expect a good homely flavor! The breakfast menu is also with trying and there is a different menu everyday! They have Christmas and new years specials too for which you need to order in advance! I personally love the pork ribs and Bacon wraps! Also don't forget to taste their cold coffee which is heavenly! The seating however is limited so take away is a good option!🙌|positive
Rated Good food... Good taste.... Good service.... In Mumbaikar language ek no restaurant..... Service is quick and staff is very friendly..... E Njoy|positive
Rated By the looks of it the place may seem small to some, but once you enter and have ordered your food you will be welcomed with some really good music and delicious food. Wraps are simply juicy and lip smacking. The pork ribs are a must try. Go, visit the place and you are sure to want to come back here again.|positive
Rated Been at this place for lunch yesterday.. Had garlic naan ..two mix indian veggies paneer chilly masala papad..good fast service..good taste..nice ambience... Good decent ambience..|positive
Rated If you are a vegetarian by choice or my force or what so very reason do go to this place if you are in dadar. I would highly recommend the banarasi kofta.|positive
Rated One of those umpteen decent food places serving almost everything fast and fresh geared for the middle class wallets. Not that it is a bad thing! During college days,didn't we all just haunt such outlets with our limited pocket monies? :D But of course now I am spoilt for choices and well,some days are just bad as I guess was the case the day I came here with mom. We were meeting my sister after lunch so this was our fast food stop. Looks very hygienic and is almost always crowded,so we took it as a good sign. Staff is very efficient and super quick. We had a pav bhaaji and a masala dosa. Pav bhaaji was good-I am not a big fan but my mom is,she liked it. Very spicy according to me but I just had 1 spoon to taste and I am biased towards sweet stuff,so shouldn't be commenting on that. My mom liked it BUT she complained of heartburn at night later which happens when she has batch of food with excessive use of chillies. Of course, 'Told you so' is not something that I want to use in front of my mom but I did tell her it was too spicy :P On the other hand,my masala dosa was extremely bland. First, the quantity of masala in the dosa was miniscule AND it seemed like it has NO chilly at all. I mean, you know, masala dosa. The masala means SOME spice,right? Anyway,I just mixed 1 spoon of mom's bhaaji from the pav bhaaji and it tasted all right :D Dosa was crunchy and the sambhar and chutney were good. They definitely need to get the balance of spices right. Or maybe it was just a bad day. Overall, nothing extraordinary but for those on a budget or really in a hurry,can check it out :) celebratemybeautifullife.blogspot.com|positive
Rated Upscaled udipi restaurant. Delivers Just what you expect from a udipi joint. You get everything here chinese, mughlai, sandwich, pizza, juices, desserts. Only reason for me not being regular at this place that this is a pure veg joint;) Jokes apart but this is one of the busiest joint you will find all throughout the week. Used to be fan paneer chilly fry which I used to order when this restaurant started, donno if it still available and has got the same taste. You get good pav bhaji and dosas here and I can say that since thats what i normally order from here!!! Sj's Ratings: Food: 3.5 Ambiance : 4.00 Service : 3 Value for Money: 3.5|positive
Rated Great quality and great taste. The quantity is good too. Ambience is fine, service is great. I mostly prefer the north indian dishes here. Chinese seems just average. A little place that is mostly packed. The food is always served hot, i appreciate that part the most.|positive
Rated Visited this place on Sunday for dinner...generally this restaurant is packed with an hour waiting but luckily that day 4of us got table in 5-10 minutes... Place looks very small frm outside but it has sitting area inside as well... Bit cramped but once food on the table you would be alright... Talking about food... Started with mounchow soup which was spicy yet gud in taste.. Later tried couple of paneer starters which were gud too and paneer quality is superb... Thn we tried paneer handi,dal tadka n heera rice so everything tasted just about perfect with good portion for 4of us. Service was quick once they started getting our order. Overall medium budget good family restaurant. Don't expect calmness in restaurant bcos generally family visits this restaurant... But for food gud gud...|positive
Rated Wanted to go here since a long time. Quite packed on Sundays though. Entered at around 7:00 pm. Place looks decent and they have a grand menu to choose from. We had a pavbhaji first. Their pav-bhaji stands among one of the best pav-bhajis I've ever had. Balanced taste. The pav they give have loads of butter, can be reduced. They had loads of tandoori items too, like kebabs and tikkas, veg though :p. We had to try the mushroom reshmi kebab. The quantity was less but the taste was great. Each piece was perfectly cooked along with the kebab coating. It was pleasant. We were not yet full, so decided to have a cream of mushroom soup. This wasn't like the typical sweet cream soups, that we usually get. It had a different flavour, more towards the sour side with the aftertaste of cream. Intelligently done, I must say. The prices are reasonable and the food quality is great.|positive
Rated We happened to drop in here just by chance, because there was a long line at another restaurant. However, my friends n I don't regret that decision. Surprisingly, the food was good, and very reasonable (had to be, it's a fast food joint). The different types of dosas were finger-licking, and the pav bhaji was good too. So, I won't mind going there again!|positive
Rated This place used to be a frequent one for me a few years ago but now I barely come here. Went back while I was in the area for a quick snack. I had the idli sambhar and it was pretty average. Chutney was bland and the sambhar was ok. Idlis were fresh and soft. Recommend the rava dosa, Chinese starters like paneer chilly and udipi style subzis where mostly all gravies taste the same. Service is fast. So if you are short on time and don't want to look for other options then come here.|positive
Rated This is an indo chinese vegetarian restaurant situated in the prime area if Dadar(West). This restaurant is cheap but serves you good quality and a lot of quantity of food. The taste is amazing. The menu is balanced. They also serve drinks and full bar is available at an average rate. The accompaniments are roasted papad with green Chutney and peanuts. The green Chutney over here has some kind of different taste and makes you to eat it all over again. The servers are good and helping and the service is quick. The ambience is soothing. Basically a proper cheap restaurant comprising of bar and vegetarian food is this place. I love this place and I am sure I will give another visit.|positive
Rated Sujata annex located in Dadar is bang opposite Prakash and adjacent to Sujata veg treat. We intended to go to sujata veg treat but accidentally reached here. Initially got a bar room, which had typical bar ambiance and not suitable for families. After sometime we were send to the main seating area which was good for families. The food was good, quantity was also sufficient, but the service was slow. May be because the cook the food freshly every time you order. So if you are very hungry then go elsewhere. The crowd was also decent. A big problem for visiting this place is parking, so avoid taking car to this this.|positive
Rated There was a time when we use to go atleast once a week to this place. Apart from being a pure veg place, it serves liquor. Also the waiting time is atleast 20-30 mins even on week days since it can accommodate only 30 people at one time. The food is excellent and the staff is very very courteous.|positive
Rated This restaurant is one of the few veg-bars located in Dadar(W) where Vegetarians can enjoy their meals along with the drinks together,also the restaurant is having nice ambience & good service where people who only want to enjoy their vegetarian meal can do so. The quantity & quality offered is also worth for money. Place seems like an expensive restaurant but its not that expensive & crowd here is salutary as the restaurant is located in a good vicinity. But there are many things which can get improved but best thing is its fully veg so a good place for all the vegetarians to dine in. So just get in,let yourself enjoy the classic veggie food of the annex.|positive
Rated Have been here a lot of times....! A perfect place for veggie day. The ambiance is not dat good but the food is good..! Do try crispy one of my favorite dishes here..!|positive
Rated We went for dinner here on 28th May, my parents anniversary. Occasions falling on Monday and Thursday warrant veg food for the otherwise hard core non-vegetarians. We ordered 2 starters, Spring rolls and Kurkura cheese. The spring rolls were hot and perfectly crisp , filled with enough veggies. It is a simple dish really, but many places go wrong with this. I absolutely loved the kurkura cheese!!! Five big mounds of goodness , each containing paneer veggie mixture enclosed between layers of cheese and potato as binding. The quantity is so much, we were full just with the starters. For the main course, we ordered a Paneer Pasanda and 3 rotis. The quantity again was more than enough and we parcelled half of it home. The paneer was fresh and the dish was as good as any. The bill with all of these items(and 2 fresh lime sodas) was just 700. They dont give home delivery sadly, but luckily it is close enough from home to pick up something on whim. Our vegetarian days are going to be seeing a lot more of Sujata food. Vidyadheesh Upadhye Thank you for the Kurkura cheese recommendation, it was truly delightful :-)|positive
Rated A nice place as per the price for the meals and the drinks too.. around the vicinity. A treat for vegeterians, and decent as in considerations the drinks provided. The service is fast. The staff and the food are equally nice. Give it a try.|positive
Rated If you are vegetarian this is the place you need to go....!!!!!! Reasonable rates not much expensive.......!!!!!! The food is delicious.....!!!! It also has a permit room just incase you would like to gulp down a few drinks with your food....!!!!!|positive
Rated Very fresh donuts. Love all the flavours. The mango one is my favourite. It's not oily at all and has quite a variety of flavours. The outlet always lures me with the aroma of fresh donuts!|positive
Rated Awesome doughnuts. Fulfills your sugar carvings, Variety is great, Sometimes few varieties are not available which is really disappointing. Never tried their milk shakes, will try some soon.|positive
Rated Good doughnuts, freshly baked to make any mood happiest! It was a small check in for me with a burger and coffee but it surely was a treat. I tried their new chocolate doughnuts and the range is good for chocolate lovers!|positive
Rated Of all chains, Krispy Kreme is defintiely my favourite by a long distance! Coming to the outlet, the ambience is really good. It is spacious and well lit and most of all, spotless! I was lucky to run in when they just made a fresh batch of the originally glazed doughnuts. Simply fabulous, melt in your mouth doughnuts. Beverages might not be one of their USPs but I loved their hot chocolate as well. Thick, creamy with a perfect amouny of cocoa - My fantasies are made up of such desserts!!|positive
Rated I remember when they first opened up around two years back and were giving away free doughnuts at neighbouring IT companies. I had a plain glazed one and it just melted in my mouth. Perfectly sweet and soft. Went in here a few days back and picked up a doughnut sundae and some other doughnut. The sundae was yum with right amounts of icecream and chocolate sauce. Not a very big fan of sprinkles though. The other chocolate filled doughnut was good as well. They have a pretty spacious seating and a bright ambiance. Wonder why the place is so empty often. Never a bad place for some coffee, doughnuts and chitchat.|positive
Rated There is not really a lot I can say about this Krispy Kreme that I haven't said for others. Sure, donuts are nice and service is good but that's the same everywhere. I just found my experience to be less fun in this particular place. The donuts were not as fresh as I have had in some places and the packing is not that great. They pack in a box only if you buy 6 or 12, otherwise, it's a paper bag. blog.husainad.com|positive
Rated We you have donuts craving! Go to krispy kreme! They are always fresh and soft! We ordered for original glaze! strawberry cupid which had a vanilla sugar coat outside and inner filling was with strawberry jam. It was soft.. the best one was the death by chocolate dream cake.. after a bite.. it was oozing out with melted chocolate. It was delicious <3|positive
Rated One of the best doughnuts I ever had. There are loads of varieties in chocolate, vanilla, mango etc. The best one is simple sugar glaze doughnut, it melts as soon as you take a bite in your mouth.|positive
Rated I like Krispy Kreme donuts. Krispy Kreme >>> Mad Over Donuts. Their donuts are always soft and since some of the donuts don't have holes, the chocolate stuffing inside never leaks and you can eat them with ease without worrying about looking like a kid. I like this spacious outlet. Eating donuts can be a messy affair and it always bugs me that MOD has tiny outlets. Thankfully Krispy Kreme powai has a large seating area. Large seating area also means that customers have a place to sit at your store and will spend longer time in it, probably ordering more, but I digress. -I took the regular size Hot Chocolate : This is meh, like most of the beverages at Krispy Kreme. -Regular Size Banana Caramel Shake : Meh, again. I expected this to be thick because of the banana but it isn't. Also, bananas have a really strong taste so you won't be able to detect the caramel flavor evenly. If you find this too sweet, finish some of it & ask them to add more milk(they won't charge extra) I also took two donuts, Chocolate Dream Cake and Kookie & Chocolate custard. They were really good donuts, I'd love to have them again. They were not overly sweet ( I was afraid of coming across this kind because of the reviews on Zomato). Every bite of the donuts were soft and the donut did not disintegrate while eating. Krispy Kreme needs to improve on these : -bring more variety of chocolate donuts. Or maybe they were just Out of Stock when I went in, so they should improve upon their inventory in that case. -Haven't seen the 'donut dhamaka' flavors in store -I understand why you're donuts are pricey, they are good quality. But the beverages ? They are nothing but run-of-the-mill ordinary and the price charged is sheer robbery. Why can't you improve them ? Just see all the reviews on Zomato. Also, in pictures you have shown the shakes with Irish cream topping, in reality, you have to pay separately for the topping ! That makes your shake more expensive than Starbucks' beverage. Still, Krispy Kreme >>> Mad Over Donuts ......for me. I'm yet to try Dunkin Donuts' donuts, so maybe that will change my opinion. Ugh Zomato, making me so fat :(|positive
Rated Dined yesterday night at this restaurant. Truly multicuisine with menu ranging from Lasagne to Salli boti and a full blown Chinese menu with a good amount of Mangalorean items thrown in. What we liked: Surmai Rawa Fry Surmai Tawa Fry Neer Dosa Crab Pulimunchi Burnt Garlic chicken Caramel Custard What we didn't like: Calcutta Biryani ( becoz we know the real thing) Bitan Datta Overall, good place with great portion sizes and superb service. Would love to visit again though it is a tad noisy on the ambience. The cocktails were great too.|positive
Rated Its more of buffet place than alacarte. The food is decent and so is the service. Ambience is good. Value for money seems a disaapointment though. Overall an average experience.|positive
Rated Loved the restaurant. Amazed, quality at its best.. Service was too fantastic.. The food was awesome too.. Loved the mocktails too.. The round table sittings are great. Perfect fine dine experience with quality. Fantastic.. Loved it.. Worth it.. Definitely worth the money.. A must visit.. �?�?|positive
Rated One thing that always made me curious about this restaurant was their grand and artistic entrance. So when i finally went there, I was happy to see that the interiors were also equally well done. We had been here for the lunch buffet and thoroughly enjoyed the delicious food as well as the service. The starters were great, especially the fried fish. Main course was just average, but that happens with most of the buffets. The variety in their cuisine is amazing, so do visit this place if you wanna try out a few different dishes.|positive
Rated First time walking out hungry from a SUNDAY BRUNCH: 1st of all it should not be called a Sunday brunch but a general buffet. Second its NOT a good buffet. Yes the price is approx 600 a person so you would expect lesser variety. So when there were only 2 starters or 1 option of soup for vegetarians, I thought that's OK, may be it tastes good. But no. Minestrone soup was a mix of tomato shorba and something probably Italian. Then came the mains. Bad. Weird mix of Indian, Italian, Chinese, Thai with 1 dish representing each. Taste. Below average. Except for yellow dal which was nice. Then the eventual disappointment of the dessert bar. Look for your self at the full array(if you can call it that). BTW who serves ladoo in dessert bar. That too if that's 1 of the 2 desserts you serve. I was on sugar free diet for a month and today I am supposed to eat sugar. But I didn't touch the desserts here. Coz I can't waste my sugar quota on this shit. So I m gonna cross the road to Thebroma and have something better. And oh I forgot to talk about salads coz what is served can hardly be called that and is worth mentioning. Disappointment scale 5/5. Positives: ambience is nice if one can eat it|positive
Rated We had gone here for a Sunday buffet for a kid's birthday party. Its a small nicely done up place which offers buffet at a reasonable price and located in a convenient location. The starters were pretty good and so was the service. The chicken was done properly and tasted good. The veg starters too very crispy and tasty. The maincourse options were limited but tasted decent and good. Overall, a nice buffet place for people who are content with a limited variety of food but good in taste.|positive
Rated An extra 0.5 for the serene and tastefully done interiors that the place offers which makes it a go-to place in Hiranandani. Although I didn't find it great so as to recommend it to someone! Preferable the buffet is a better option than the A la carte since its more value for money. Went here yesterday and was already getting hungry, so directly tried the mains. Ordered the Mirch ka Murg and Bhuna Pyaz-ka-murg. Well this was what they suggested us for a better gravy option, although we got quite let down by the taste. It was good but definitely not great. Finally the Calcutta biryani saved our night as it was quite delicious with small cubes of tender lamb(we preferred lamb over chicken). After not such a great dining experience we preferred limiting ourselves to this much only.|positive
Rated Had been to this place as part of office team celebration for dinner on a Friday, we were a group of 13. While the place has an amazing ambiance, the food isn't that great. Totally not worth the expensive menu, the service deteriorated once the restaurant was full. Plus I had found a strand of hair in my plate on reporting this to the staff all they did was replace my plate. Surely not visiting this place again or recommending it to anyone|positive
Rated Had to wait for 15 mins even on a wednesday (weekday) eve.. but I chose to, as I wanted to try Red Olives. These 15 mins felt like 15 hours as I was super hungry. ok so the restaurant is done up well.. & was all packed with corporate crowd & families mainly. Being super hungry & little confused as they have a whole lot of cuisines to offer we took help of the staff so as to what could be the best thing to order. To start with called for kebab e lazeez (chicken) for starters which was very tender but a little less flavoured & chicken thai green curry with Jasmine rice for the main course. Thai curry was pretty good but Jasmine rice was just usual with nice aroma but nothing different in taste. I guess the staff is only trained to serve whereas communication is a little problem but Service is good on the whole. Seatings not too comfy for me.. Nice experience overall...|positive
Rated Don't take it wrong but for food it is 5/5 due to service I gave it 3.5. Really the food is awesome veg non veg both starters are great even main course was awesome but a kill improvement is required at desserts counter and the most refurnishing is required towards their service side. The staff is sooooo rude at least teach ur staff to smile and for a single thing we need to ask for 3-4 times and see the face of those rude people. But at food taste quality no complaints literally.. Hope to see the improvement on my next visit.|positive
Rated The best thing about sigree is it has Huge space! Huge tables! Huge starters & main course spread! You feel free to roam around with your plate as it's clutter free. Ambience is good and yes it's always occupied! Food tastes better on weekdays compared to weekends. Starters are amazing! What I like about sigree starters is they don't use single theme , you get variety and that replenishes your taste buds. Main course has a wide spread along with some delicious deserts. Experience was good everytime but weekdays are always better , so visit on weekdays!|positive
Rated A lavish buffet always excites me☺ Sigree does offer you one. Located in the hustling street of powai, this place is full of people from the corporate sector (on weekdays atleast). It truly is commendable for the amazing global cuisine experience they provide. When compared to barbeque nation, it surely offers you alot more variety in the same category. The cherry on the cake is the live pasta and risotto counter and amazing service :) The only thing disliked here is the welcome drink. Also, if you want to try everything you need to have little of all :) and try skipping the bread part as it bloats the stomach before the delicious main course ;) The dessert stomach we all have is blessed with the variety offered here :D|positive
Rated Amazing place with lots of variety Concept of Barbeque grill Nice ambience Good music Always fun to come here Been here twice Starters are too filling Veg and non veg , both have lots of variety Service is good But if the group is large it will be difficult to get a seat here on weekends (on the spot basis) So I suggest reservation if group is large (6+) I celebrated my moms bday and my bday here Both times food was good Quality was amazing Quantity was very good as it is unlimited food Welcome drink can be better Cost-4.5/5 Food- 4/5 Quantity- 5/5 Quality- 4/5 Service-4/5 Ambience- 4/5|positive
Rated The restaurant has a nice ambience and when we visited their Punjabi festival was going on. Owing to that the place was decorated, waiters wearing turbans and Punjabi pop songs playing in the background. Having experienced bbq at Bbqn, I went here with high hopes and wanting to tantalise my taste buds! But alas...this place did not live up to my expectations. The food was average, service was extremely slow and we we waiting for long to get our bbqs to be filled. Unlike Bbqn, once our bbq started, the starters did not keep coming. It lacked variety and some veg starters tasted really strange. In nonveg only fish and prawns were good, chicken was very average. Buffet was good and would say better than starters. Desert was good.|positive
Rated This place is more or less like BBQ nation. Both of them have table grill. Currently they are celebrating Punjab Festival ,I found nothing amusing about it though. The starters and main course though were mostly Punjabi dishes but then that's what you get in every other restaurant in the city. The food was good nothing that I can complain about. Service was great, they kind of have open door policy u can literally ask any one and they'll help you. The ambiance was nice . Just wish if they could add some more varieties in their starters and main course SIGREE GLOBAL GRILL POWAI Sigree Global Grill|positive
Rated I must say the whole ambience was top class. I liked the way they have arranged the buffet so as to not disturb the customers. The food quality is again something that I appreciate here. Compared to the other outlets that give such weekday lunch offer, Sigree has maintained its standard in terms of delivering quality dishes.|positive
Rated Mission exploration of Powai began with a bang Sigree global grill is simply a great place for a buffet. We had a Punjabi menu on board and it never disappointed!! Spot on with Bhatai jingaa, lasoon murgh tikka, Rawalpindi da murgh and the dumplings which were out of the world! Pizza was decent and chessy. Make your own pasta(only veg) which satisfactory. The mains Mutton chape kheema te kalegi was outstanding. Butter chicken and Mutton vale chawaal were other greats! Desserts of chocolate mousse, mango mousse, jalebi with rabdi, ice cream(awesome), bread pudding and gulab jamun were good too! Really ended with meal well. And a complimentary lassi was offered to everyone which really helped everything settle well! Quantity 10/10 Quality 8.5/10 Service 7/10(A tad bit slow) Hygiene 9/10 Location 8/10|positive
Rated Sunday Peak Time Bias Alert..... So a friend is moving to another city and we thought to have a farewell lunch as we were 3 couples and two kids so decided on a buffet. We checked previous day and got the booking only for 2 pm. We reach on time friends still on the way and I realise even with prior booking its 30-45 min wait. Place was ear piercingly noisy with all tables full as they had punjabi festival. We are seated by 2.45 and table grill was set....we were all veg so they started getting the tikkas...bharwan potato, pineapple broccoli capsicum and a paneer tikka. That's it for the veg. All 3 were decent in taste and fresh but there was nothing wow in it. We quickly move to main course at 3.15 as they close at 3.45. Few things were yet to be refilled which was done after asking. Overall spread was large enough with regularly tasting punjabi dishes of good quality but it was missing any uniqueness in taste or presentation. Same with the desserts..... Overall it was a good experience but I am sure weekends are not great time to be here and have a lazy cozy lunch or dinner.|positive
Rated Best known for its live music and ambience. For me nothing is better than spending an evening chilling at Bluefrog listening to some progressive rock and drinking a beer.|positive
Rated Blue frog is a place where you can grove , enjoy and forget the world , I have to give it to blue frog team for this , amazing artists , great job , recently goa gill was playing and it was amazing .|positive
Rated The litmus festival held last weekend had this blue frog as a venue for its various shows being performed on stage.. Loved the sitting area and service.. Everything was upto the mark.. Had ordered few drinks and pesto sandwich.. Was completely filling and not so expensive.. Its not only night place.. One can also spend a good time in daylight..|positive
Rated BlueFROG is a place that one must visit for the overall feel of it. Lovely music being played in the perfect setting with good food, good drinks and perfect service. Although over-priced, it is a good place. One of the best in Bombay in terms of ambiance. Must visit!|positive
Rated It's one of the legends like if staying in Bombay you have missed this means you have really missed the club culture here, the amount of celebs have been here to play n enjoy is just amazing. Some legends have played music here. One of its kind. Must visit. Love the food too. Best parties.|positive
Rated Went yesterday to blue frog for Goa gill event. Restaurant was full as expected. Goa gill (baba ji) is a well known DJ in India and world wide. Trans music as its best. First the positives music awesome this guy can play non stop for 7 to 8 hours and was at his best. We were dancing like crazy... a perfect high.Very good crowd,food,music,location. AC was good being so crowded. The only and big disappointment was staff service (very poor). Blue frog is a pub which hosts events on regular intervals.Prices differs event to event. Entry charge 1500 for this event per person. Restaurant is costly which is again expected from the place because of the location and town crowd. One of the best thing about blue frog is ambience, very nice setup. Feels like a European movie hall. Balcony is the bar area, then the premium seating area and executive the dance floor space. 1. Food 4.5/5 Ordered oven roasted chicken in jerk marinade. The dish had four large pieces of chicken. Chicken was good and the gravy was also nice. The rice was super delicious, it had coconut pieces and the marinade (mixture of oil,spice) complimented it. There was a little kind of piri piri kind off sauce, which was made of coconut and tasted really nice. Had red bull which costed me 290. They have people selling same red bull and few snacks outside with lesser price, so one can opt for that option as well. 2. Value for money 5/5 The charges are high but the place has every right to charge with good offerings. A high end pub in lower parel will charge you as per their likings because of the reach and buyers. 3. Ambience 5/5 as described earlier ambience is the usp of place, very beautiful. 4. Staff service 1/5 very poor, staffs are rude, not interested, politeness no where in there gesture. I am talking about when the place was not filled in, earlier part of the evening. I paid my money in cash and the asked for the balance amount at least four times. I gave 100 rupees for bottle of water cost for it was 86 and did not get my balance asking twice, then I left. So you can imagine about the rush hour service.5. Location 5/5 walk-able distance from lower parel station. Located with all the food joints like todi mill social,chaayos,cafe zoe,etc. I will recommend blue frog for particular events as at the end of the day for me goa gill music was the key. He was the king of the night.|positive
Rated Amazing place to go to if u r planning for a thrilling weekend night with yr buddies. The cover charges are only 500 bucks per head for stag entry. Dance floor is spacious with all the seating arrangements done all around it in circular boxes giving u good view of what is happening around. Moreover the bar area stretches the entire length of the club giving u ample of space to sit and stand. There is also a mini bar adjacent to dance floor. Crowd along with ambience is excellent. Cheese pizza is too crispy and a delight too eat when u r too high. Martini's along with some other drinks don't take much time while being served.|positive
Rated Blue frog is the best place in Mumbai for live music performances. The quality of music here is in unparalleled. The food is expensive compared to the quality they provide. Go for the music and drinks more than the food.|positive
Rated Located in mathuradas mill compound, this is best place in town where u can enjoy music & live performance with decent food, unique dining experience , food here lil costly, but worth it , it was life tym experience for me, i love to visit this place again|positive
Rated Went here to watch Anand Reghu stand up comedy..... booked a table for 3 ..... pretty cool place for live bands, dj , stand up comedies... We ordered : - garlic pepper prawns - thai spiced chicken - lemon mustard fish - French fries Chicken dish is a must try as well cooked and tender enough to melt down... Prawns dish was also pretty good and cooked to perfection ..... Fish dish was the worst as fish was smelling ....... when asked to waiter ... he took the dish back immediately and brought nachos salad which we assumed was complimentary ... nachos salad were perfect ... best i have ever had in mumbai ..... Once the bill came , fish item was on the bill and when asked to server Ritesh, he said as u ordered fries and u also ate nachos salad ..... it is equivalent to the amount of 2 dishes .... Wonder why they gave impression of nachos was complimentary.... Guess blue frog needs to work on this aspect of stop assuming things and be clear in their communications ... Would have given a 4 rating all thanks to chicken, prawns , nachos salad .... but as they screwed at bill time .... deserves a 3 rating . Bill picture attached for reference Surely will visit this place again .... just that will order nachos salad and pay for it .... Happy dining|positive
Rated They have a limited menu. Tibetian vegetable momos here are pretty good. We also had Burmese kaukswe, which was pretty decent but I can’t really compare as this was the first time I ever tried kaukswe. The service was very slow. The ambience is nice. Overall whether its food or service it’s pretty average nothing exceptional about it and specially when its situated in the same vicinity as few really good restaurants one should skip this one, There are better options around|positive
Rated Just a quick review !!!! Busago was on my list fr a long time .... I was always intrigued by it simple menu, its focus on flavours and using freshest ingredients in preparations ! So for I quick meal I ordered a chicken spicy chilli noodles for delivery ..... To my surprise the wok tossed flat rice noodles were bland and tasteless ..... It had none the typical asian sweet sour spicy flavours !!!! Maybe just a hint of red chilli paste n soya at best ! What a let down !!! anandtiwari.in|positive
Rated I like the stuff at Busago. Had been to their BKC outlet earlier and went here with the same impression but this one is bigger and better. The interiors are also done up quirkily, bright painted chairs gives it a lovely ambience. I'm a fan of their Gado Gado salad. Its a must try. Then we had the khowsuey which is one of their specials and rightly so. Service is quick too. Ideal for a quick lunch during office hours|positive
Rated Was here on a weekday..maybe thats why the entire place was empty. I am sure it would completely different on a weekend. So we 4 were the only ones here and they started the music also after 20mins. Loved the simple yet quirky decor. Food was good too..especially the chicken Dimsums. Would definitely recommend but not on a weekday though...unless you want the whole place to yourself.|positive
Rated While I've been to the Busagos elsewhere, this is the only one which has been my regular choice to order in due to its proximity to work and home. Their quality is consistent and Khao Suey being my ultimate comfort food, automatic brownie points for making such good Burmese. I absolutely love the fact that all the accompaniments come in little packets which can be added as per our own choice and liking. Their cambodian curry is great too. There's no difference between having this at home or at the restaurant. Just one grievance that they've increased their pricing for no reason. Otherwise, great stuff!|positive
Rated Busago - FTW ! For the kind of pricing they offer, the food is killerThe beef bulgogi was fantastic and so were the khowsuey and the cambodian chicken curry Dont miss the nimbu nariyal paani if you do visit With the amount the mathuradas compound is abused with pubs, this seems like a great place to start or end the night|positive
Rated This place, frankly, blew me away with the value for money it offers. The food is delicious and filling, and the ambience is relaxed and fun. The kaukswe is a great dish to share because of the customizability. The only thing preventing me from giving this a 5 is the fact that the lighting inside in the evening wasn't good, so my pictures didn't turn out great.

Rated an excellent place to try some new asian flavours for a relaxed lunch at todi mills..d place has a cheerful ambiance with big windows and a cute lil decor..we tried d tibetan veg momo, the beautiful & damned and the best of it all Burmese Kaukswe Veg...The Khowsuey is one of the best I have ever tried.. they give u d ingredients and you are supposed to toss up a dish for yourself!!not just the shenanigans of making a dish but the flavours were really strong and authentic..d service is courteous...all in all it turned out to be a great experience..|positive
Rated O: Cha You Beauty! The entrance would just not prepare you for the interiors. Its Grand, Plush and Snazzy. The High Ceiling, The unique bamboo lanterns and that huge mirror on the wall, the long bar, the buddha masks.. All of it would leave you bedazzled! Landed here on a Wednesday evening and it was packed for a weekday evening. Here's what we had and almost all of it left us delighted. Drinks: Lemon Grass Basil Martini- The Happy High. This lemon grass based vodka based drink made the alcoholic in me jump out of joy and that basil flavor provided the much needed edge to this fabulous drink. Orange and Kaffir Lime Caprioska- The tangy orangy taste against the bitterness of the Kaffir Lime and vodka was an absolute party starter. Kiwi and Honey Mojito- Gone are the days of the lemon and basi mojito.. Move on Baby. OC's take on a classic Mojito and its to absolutely die for. Stiff and Lipsmackingly Good. A Must Have. Food: Dim Sum- My Favorite food item. A good Dimsum has the super power of leaving you with the happiest feeling that exists on the face of the Earth. Shitake Mushroom Dumpling- Packed in a thin dimsum sheet is the flavorful filling of well seasoned shitake mushrooms and carrots that will almost make you fall in love with Veg food. Chicken and Prawns SuiMai- OMIGOD.. I was in Food Heaven. Juicy, melt in the mouth generous filling wrapped in a thin sheet and served with a spicy chilly sauce. I am salivating as I recall! Crispy Potato and Okra tossed in Black Pepper- My respect for Vegetarian food increased tremendously purely based on this dish. Crispy potato and crisp Okra, spiced with back pepper is delightfully soul satisfying. I coud go back only for this. Prawn Cake in Lemon Grass- Minced Prawn, spiced up to perfection stuck on a stick of lemongrass is so juicy that just cant stop at one. Served with a spicy chilly sauce, it made for an ideal accompaniment for drinks. Thai Pandana Leaf wrapped Chicken- Dont judge a book by its cover- It doesn't look very interesting but once you unwrap that leaf, the smells wafting from within would make you stomach grumble from hunger. One bite and you're in heaven. Its crispy on the outside, juicy and succulent on the inside. You cant stop at one! Nasi Goreng Rice- The Indonesian style rice, tossed in veggies is sticky and sweet and spicy- all at the same time and is a meal in itself. The crunch of the veggies against the softness of the rice is a mindblowingly gooood combination. Desserts: Banana Tempura with Honey Sesame and Coconut Ice Cream-Banana Fritters, topped with sesame seeds and served on a bed of coconut ice cream. Crunchy exterior and gooey interior, not overly sweet, the fritters are mouthwatering and combine that with Ice cream with a subtle flavor of Coconut.. Now that's the reason we all have a separate stomach for desserts. Chilli Chocolate Tart- I would have liked the tart to be a little more cooked but the chocolate spiced with a hint of chily made up for that. Its a better combination than it sounds. Chocolate and Chilly can actually be Good Friends. Opposites do Attract! A Flawless Climax to an Optimal Meal.|positive

Rated It is a nice Resturant at mathuradas mill compound near Zaffran in Lower Parel.. It serves asian cuisine... Interiors are very nice and service was also good... They had a big screen to watch IPL t20... Also they had a special menu for ipl... We ordered veg tomyum soup which was spicy and nice ...in appetisers we ordered veg dimsum which was not nice.. Veg Hakka noodles was nice and veg gravy was also nice... Nice for 1 time visit...or if you like asian food...|positive
Rated My oh my!! This place has some amazing interiors. We have already fallen in love with their ceiling lanterns. We recently visited this place which also happened to be a karaoke night. The place has some refreshing vibe which makes you feel really good. We wanted to try their new pan Asian menu so we went ahead and placed our order for dumplings, tofu, pandan wrapped chicken, Thai chicken and Cantonese pot rice. We would recommend all of these. The sriracha tofu was a special delight. The dips which they offer along with chicken, amazingly tingle on your taste buds. In dessert we loved the banana tempura with sesame and honey. Its basically fried banana topped with honey and sesame, served with coconut ice-cream. The chilly chocolate tart was also a delight. Overall Experience: Great. The evening was filled with food and amazing music. Would visit again soon to try their IPL special menu.|positive
Rated Surprisingly it was not at all busy on a Sunday evening, which I was glad about because that gave me the freedom to speak freely with my friends and enjoy the ipl match ... For which they have a special ipl food and drinks menu. I tried their KKR special - chawla's manchurian which was nice. The dimsums were great. The Thai curry, kungpao curry was well made. The dessert was not as per my liking but my friends really enjoyed it. The staff was courteous and prompt. The overall was experience was good|positive
Rated This review has been pending for a long time now. Just when it was opened, I visited O:h cha and was instantly blown away by the energy of the place. The techno interiors and ambience gave a nice peppy feeling. We ate a lot that day. Wanted to taste the best on offer, we really stuffed ourselves. We started off with some veggie dim-sums served with great sauces. Contrary to dim-sums otherwise, these ones were very tasty. The mix of select veggies was a dance in my mouth. We had a really tasty, but super spicy, glass noodle salad. The long yard bean sambal was decent. There was a very strong garlic flavour that was overpowering. But the choice of ingredients was good. We topped off our meal with Banana Tempura with Honey, Sesame & Coconut Ice Cream. Super Yum! Go there for a great night out in town. Good food. Good music. Energetic Place.|positive
Rated Introductions are for people or a thing that you don’t know or haven’t met before but that isn’t the case for this famous thai restaurant. Authentic thai cuisine is something which is not found in many places here. There was a time when if you wanted to have authentic thai cuisine the only place that would come to your mind would be thai pavilion and a couple of more restaurants here there but things have changed since then and we have seen some new authentic thai restaurants coming to the city. ...

Rated 3.75 /5 to be specific. We decided to head there on a Friday afternoon for lunch . Ambiance and service - lovely ambience. Loved it Food and drinks - Apple and cucumber Fizz - fresh apple, cucumber and apple juice with honey. The cucumber flavour was a little overpowering for us. Orange and Kaffir lime- Khaffir lime with mango chunks and organ cr juice . Very refreshing in taste as well as in the looks . This drink will surely help you beat the heat outside . Burnt garlic and basil soup - medium thick broth made with chicken and veggies . Very soothing to the palate and packed with flavours. Mushroom bruschetta - perfectly crisp base with a unique blend of toppings. Surely a good choice for the vegetarians. 3 style mushroom dumpling - steamed dumplings with 3 different styles of mushrooms. A great dish for all the mushroom lovers. Stir fried pepper turnip cake- never thought I would say this but yes I loved this dish. Never thought turnip cakes could taste soo delicious. Made in black pepper sauce, this dish is surely a dish one can just keep on eating. Grilled prawn cakes on lemon grass skewers - didn't enjoy it as much as the other dishes due to the smell of raw fish emitted by the prawns. Chicken balls in hakka style - this was something like any regular chicken balls. A good dish however not a great one. Another disappointing dish. Gai hor bai toey - Thai Pandan wrapped chicken with sriracha lemon chilli garlic sauce. Different flavours that came together very well in the dish. Chicken nasi goreng - star of the afternoon. Highly recommended. Thai red and green curry - very disappointing... After having tried the authentic curries in Thailand these were highly disappointing. Yaki udon noodles - another authentic dish which one surely has to develop a taste for . Not meant for everyone , but surely worth a try . Passion fruit pudding - nice sweet and tangy mix of flavours. Liked it. Chocolate chilli tart - yes u have read it right it's chocolate and chilli together. This is one of the recommended desserts of the menu . You can't go home without trying this out. Banana tempura with honey sesame and coconut ice cream - the banana tempura was just perfect and the coconut icecream added a refreshing and nice texture to the whole dessert. This is something different and highly recommended Overall we had a wonderful experience and will surely visit the place again.|positive
Rated This place is brilliant! We organised an office social at oh cha. The first thing that strikes about this place is the service. Right from the beginning the staff was courteous and took good care of the guests. We loved everything that they served. Their prawns in chilli and black pepper were the best. Stir fried vegetables starters were nice and crisp. One should definitely also try the thai green curry with jasmine rice. I am biased towards noodles and their wheat hakka noodles were very well made and not oily at all. Can't talk about portions since we went on a corporate package but the quality of the food and the service was top notch!|positive
Rated Visited Oh Cha a couple of weeks ago to try out their new Pan Asian menu. Things to try from this menu are - The soft melt in your mouth Siracha Tofu. Crispy okra and potatoes tossed in pepper. Swipe this dish clean inspite of it being vegetarian. Prawn Cakes with a sweet chilli sauce were quite nice too. The Thai Pandan wrapped crispy chicken was different & quite delicious. From main course, the prawns in Black Bean sauce were realllllly good and is a must try. The Chocolate Chilli Tart too was good. Only once you finish that first spoon do you get that hit of chilli.|positive
Rated I have ordered burgers from here twice and have tried both their vegetarian and non veg burgers. The chicken coron bleu burger is undoubtedly one of their best. The burgers are very different from the other chains present throughout India and have far more resemblence to the Indian taste with the pickled onions and higher heat. But even though the taste is great, I was not blown away by their other burgers. And also, their fries are really bad. I will probably try to have a dine-in experience as well soon. Would definitely recommend everyone to have a try atleast once.|positive
Rated It's a small cozy place located in a corner near Joey's pizza. It's blink and you miss it kinda thing. The place has a few tables (4-5) and it has a nice ambience. They play soft music and the lighting just takes you to another place. Although it's not very big, their menu will leave you spoilt for choice. The variety of food is really good and it tastes good too. The burgers are a bit messy to have and you definitely need 2 hands for it, but it's completely worth it. The fries are average. The Pizzas have good variety, as do the burgers. The best part is the sliders, where you can get 2 or 12! It's a good place to chill and have a nice quiet meal with a few people. They have a nice set of drinks too. FYI they have a burger challenge too!! You have to eat a 1.2 kg burger in 25 mins and you get it free with your pic on the wall. One of the few places in India to have such challenges.Average cost for 2 people approx Rs. 500-700|positive
Rated This place looks like a tiny cafe but the array of burgers and pizzas it offers will astonish you. Ordered the fish and chips and the fish was exceptional. The chips were nice too. The barbeque chicken pizza was tasty though I felt that the generous amounts of barbeque sauce made it a tad bit sweet. The classic chicken burger was really nice, minced chicken patty, caramelised onions and cheese. Will visit here next for some more burgers.|positive
Rated After lot of positive reviews on zomato i deicided to visit this place..this one is really small cafe located at Link rd junction nxt to very famous pizza joint..they have hardly 4 table sitting & interiors are nothing fansy...I ordered roast chicken burger with cheese and it was good..presentation was nice..chicken was juicy & patty was roasted properly..though i didnt like side potato wedges...if you consider overall taste of the burger then they do have some scope of improvment.|positive
Rated Tried this place one afternoon with my frnd. It is a really tiny place with about 5 tables. This cafe wont offer u a great ambience but it covers up with its lip-smacking food. We ordered a pesto pasta, potato wedges and pair of mini burgers. ( They have miniburgers available in pair, half a dozen and a dozen). This gives us an opportunity to try a wide variety of burgers economically :). In our pair we ordered bbq chiken and crab mince. BBQ chicken slider was succulent and i liked the crab minced one too ( It is coming from a person who doesnt like eating seafood!). Pesto pasta great...wedges not so yum. Had a good chat with the owner who was warm and polite. In al it was an afternoon well spent.|positive
Rated After being highly recommended we decided to give it a try. Located right next to a wine shop 😈 and very close to Joey's Pizza. Obviously they have tuff competition but they still stand out. Ambience is below average but that doesn't matter if the restaurants putting it's efforts in serving good food n service. Food - We called for Chicken Mushroom burger. It was huge! Thick minced chicken patty, mushroom slices n not too much Mayo. The burger was just perfect. Fish n chips - I'm always skeptical while ordering this. Not many restaurants serve good fish n chips. Cafe on the house is not one of them. The fish was deep fried Basa tasted good and fries were thin n crispy similar to what u get in MC'd along with Tartar sauce. It was worth spending our weekend evening at Cafe on the house. They also hVe challenges like if you manage to finish their HUGE burger which apparently weighs 1.5 kgs 😱 in 25mins you go on their wall of fame and the burger is on the house.|positive
Rated He'd heard really good things about this place. The food is really good and it's really under appreciated for all that it has to offer! Had a good time here..|positive
Rated Here is the latest update on my previous review dated June 2015 . Initially visited this hidden gem in May 2015, the menu was quite limited. Initially , they just had 4 (NV) burgers to choose from : *Cordon Bleu: The magnum opus of COTH. This is what a perfect stuffed burger should be. A Batter-fried chicken patty with an mozzarella cheesy centre filling. *BBQ Chicken: Shredded chicken in a slightly spicy BBQ sauce. *Bacon & Sausage: Recommended for pork lovers �?� *Classic Chicken Cheese Burger : Typical chicken patty with cheese, passable.�?� It was in June that they initiated that WTF burger challenge. A massive multilayered burger with fries to be completed in 25 minutes flat. So far I guess only 6 people have just finished the burger let alone were successful win in the challenge. Since then, COTH has expanded its menu to include a wider range of burgers �?� (also introducing the stuffed burgers concept) as a wider range of pastas and pizzas. Since my last review, I have had the stuffed burgers and pastas . Usually most joints idea of a stuffed burger is to stuff it with cheese. COTH just tweaks that idea. The Burger has more meat stuffed in it. Would recommend the “Mushroom & Cheddar Cheese�? and �? Honey Roasted Ham & Mozzarella�? Burgers. The pasta �?? is another thing that is surprisingly good. Recommendations include: *Carbonara, * Bolognaise * Pink sauce The best drink in the house is the Safe Sex on the beach. The rest are passable. They have currently stopped the 15% discount on Citi Card holders due to lack of customers. However, they are planning to launch a new burger challenge in June in addition the existing challenge. Finish any burger in a record stipulated time, the burger will be free for you on your next visit onwards (T&C) – provided no one breaks your record.😎 Maintaining my rating of over 4/5 for this joint.|positive
Rated Going to Cafe on the House is a big task as you have resist Joeys Pizza which is located right next to it. However, we were quite determined to visit this place as some good reviews were pouring in. Warning : People who plan to visit this place, be prepared to gain some extra calories. The Junk Food → 3/5 ■ Chicken Cordon Bleu - Recommended by Zomato, it is a good option. The filling was good (deep fried chicken patty) but i found their bread a bit over toasted. The Burger was complimented with potato wedges and they were simply amazing. ■ Sliders - We ordered two Mini Burgers, out of which i enjoyed Minced lamb Burger more. Filet-O-Fish was a little disappointing. Even here, the bread was an issue. ■ Lemon Coriander Pizza - This was easily the best pick of the day. It was thin crust with chicken chunks seasoned in Lemon. Though i am not a big fan of thin crust, the pizza here was absolutely amazing. ■ Mocktails - Grapefruit Mint Cooler was pretty okay. Frozen Margherita (Kiwi) was worth a try. Wanted to try their Prawns Burger (sounds delicious) but unfortunately they were out of stock. Ambience - 2/5 The place is really small with four tables. However, its not about the size, its how you maintain it. The exterior looked really messy. Unfortunately, their AC was located near our table and it was leaking. Please maintain your place better. Service - 3.5/5 No issues with their service. They were nice and courteous. They have a challenge where we have to complete their 'WTF' burger within 25 minutes. Its really humongous and needs a special appetite to complete it. If we are successful, it is free of cost otherwise be ready to shell out 800 bucks. For this challenge i will surely visit this place again with my friends. Its a good place to hangout. Still, they have to improve alot.|positive
Rated This place has taken me by total surprise. I've ordered around thrice from here now. We have exhausted all the places around office and this is my current favorite. What we ordered: Quattro stagoni pizza: overloaded with all my favourite toppings. The 9inch is totally enough to fill up 2 people with maybe a side dish. Great quantity great taste. Nothing not to love about this. Barbeque chicken wings: Perfectly flavored chicken wings. I would have preferred it slightly more spicy but still they were totally delicious. Chicken burger: I don't remember the name but this one was recommended by zomato. Just another yummy dish. Came woth potato wedges and what I really liked was it wasn't dry at all. Filled with sauces I was left wanting more. Overall , yes totally gonna order again. Also whoever takes the order over the phone is really nice. I've never visited the place but the delivery is always on time. And the food is totally worth the price. Must try!|positive
Rated My fellow foodies.... In this hot summer afternoon, i had no where else to be at nariman point but this wonderful restaurant SPESSO. The ambience is so welcoming. They have this open kitchen thing that totally makes you go "oooohhhh" The pizzas and pastas were one heck of taste bud lovers. They have some good coolers and mocktails to soothe your thirst. What we mainly were attracted by was their yummy to core desserts. The hazelnut chocolate pot and the chocolate sand were heavenly. Took no time to get done and over with. The service was pretty decent too. Also do not forget to carry your college i cards for you will get lucky and get 15% dicount buddies. And if at all in the end you're totally loaded...you can always walk it out at nariman just a lane away. 😄😃😋|positive

Rated An extremely nice restaurant at Nariman Point. Looking it from outside we thought that it is an ordinary restaurant with exotic name. But when we entered the place, found it altogether different than expected. It has got nice interiors and spacious seating arrangement. The food is good here, especially the pasta. One of the things you must not miss is the desserts here. They have a library of desserts, there are so many varieties that you cannot go out without having one. Service is good here, people are very attentive, cooperative and courteous. They take utmost care to make you comfortable. They helped us in choosing the pasta as well. Parking could be an issue here, i am not sure if they have valet parking.|positive
Rated This restaurant was in my wishlist for long time and we decided to give it a try on very special occasion. Even on a weekday made prior booking as i was in no mood to encounter any fiasco. I had gone thru many reviews and as per many recommendations we ordered variety of starters from bruchetta, garlic bread to seven layered mexican shots and cheese cigars and believe me those starters looked beautiful and tasted even better. Mexican pizza which we tried in main course was spicy but very tasty. Mexican rice in chipotle sauce was another main course which we ordered, it was good in taste but the chipotle sauce tasted somewhat similar to makhni gravy. Mocktails were good and liked the combinations as well. Prices although are to the higher side but the place in worth giving a try for vegitairians.|positive
Rated Situated at Nariman Point, this place serves one of the best pasta I have had. We orderedMoroccan Chermoula Grill and Assorted Bruchettas for starters. The bruchettas had a lovely topping of tomato, olives, bell peppers and zucchini. The dish was light on your palette and refreshing. The Mexican Chermoula Grill was greeted with mix reviews. On one hand, me and my friend we both agreed that the paneer was super soft and super fresh - something which is mandatory in a paneer dish else it becomes a turn off. But, I personally didn't get the Moroccan spices and I felt it needed more seasoning. But, the star of the afternoon was their Pasta Arrabiatta. 2 slices of crispy, buttery garlic bread to accompany it, the pasta sauce was to die for. Perfectly balanced between the tanginess of the tomato and sweetness from the added sugar, it left a desirable after taste in your mouth. Do try Spesso for their pasta and beautiful ambiance!|positive
Rated Ambience is good. Staff is friendly. Good variety of food as well as mocktails being offered. Loved the quesilladas, 7 layer Mexican shots and chocolate pot. Must visit place for all Italian Mexican food lovers.|positive
Rated Never knew that so many cuisines can be presented in a quirky manner with pure vegetarian ingredients!The place is beautiful and one of the best mexican food i have tried!The strawberry margarita was very juicy n just added to the flavour of the food.Its not even that expensive if you compare with the quantity cause its quite good and has a huge variety of cuisines n dishes.I also had the Veg Lasagna n Mexican shots n it was yummy.In all a nice place to chill with family n friends .So if you had a long dat just come down here n loose yourself in some amazing delicacies!|positive
Rated 587 reviews as i write mine, tells you a lot about this place which has been visited by patrons from every corner of the city. Saturday late afternoon and people are moving out after satisfying their palates, that's when we step in to satiate our hunger. After being led to our table, we quickly ordered mocktails, mock sangria and tall summer sipper along with kung pao cottage cheese. The sangria had a grape juice base and equal taste of apple and orange juices, tasted quite refreshing after all the travel. The tall summer sipper, a twisted version of mojito, coz with the usual lime n mint combo, there was a hint of raw mango n green apple syrup. The taste was very similar but it had an wow factor. The cottage cheese was the best dish of the meal. The spicy-sweet sauce which was added in the right proportion tingled our taste buds. Quantity was sufficient for two and every bite was thoroughly enjoyed, still feel the taste as i write this review. For the main course we ordered lasagna al forno. I don't have prior experience was having a lasangna, so i cannot comment regarding the authenticity and the taste compared to original. The one we had was good enough to be devoured, tastes best when hot and the oregano seasoning adds a much required flavour to the dish. Service was quick and the staff were attentive to our requirements. Go there with as many people as you can, coz they have a variety of dishes and hopefully all of them are lip smackingly good.|positive
Rated It's. Been a while since I've written a review mainly because, i haven't been going out much. So after nearly a year of trying to find the time for this highly recommended place I finally got around to it. First and foremost if you do have a valet service available (that too chargeable which I don't mind looking at the crowded locality it is in) at least have someone standing there.I waited for a min no one showed up so I had to move because I was blocking the traffic I finally had to park inside palladium. Coming to the restaurant the ambiance and decor is pretty decent no complaints there.To start off I had to try the kalakhatta mojito and being someone who isn't a fan of mojito I enjoyed every sip of my drink, we obviously had to order the pav bhaji fondue Coz it was recommended by everyone who's been here and now I know why. It was probably the highlight of my meal. I was however disappointed by the main course where on the captains recommendation we tried the tawa khada Masala which was pretty basic, It was like any other Vegetarian dish at any regular restaurant don't have any complaints about the taste but It wasn't up to the spice Klub standards I suppose. Although the chilli cheese garlic naan is something I would strongly recommend any one who is reading this. On to the dessert, a strong recommendation from a friend had to try the flower pot! And that thing was out of this world, be it the Pot and the spoons itself made up of delicious creamy chocolate or the ras malai inside it was really good.! Also I loved the fact that they gave 2 chocolate spoons 1 made up of dark chocolate and the other with milk chocolate. All in all a pretty good experience although there is a lot more I want to try on the menu which I couldn't this time so I'm definitely visiting this place again. Food: 4/5 Ambience: 3.5/5 Service: 4/5 Value for money: 3/5|positive
Rated If you got your pockets full and you've decided to have North Indian fine dine, this place is for you. One of the best place I've visited till date. Staff were so helpful, yeah obviously because of this place's reputation we had to wait for an hour but it was worth waiting. Ordered nannza, cheese roomali papad and pav-bhaji fondue from appetizers which were mouth-watering. Loved the food.�?� Ratings- Food 5/5 Ambiance 5/5 Value for money 4.5/5 **A MUST VISIT PLACE** Am I going to visit again? Yes, I will! Thumbs up.�?�|positive
Rated Innovative food and really really tasty stuff is what you'll find here. It's a little heavy on the pocket ofcourse, but you get amazing food here. Pav Bhaji fondue is my favourite. Also the appetiser called naanza is delicious. Dessert is always the soap cake, which literally melts in the mouth!! Must visit for an awesome experience.|positive
Rated An OMG place. They have just transformed your whole eating experience and made it completely extra ordinary. Loved each an every bit of this place, I guess the only drawback would be the waiting, really really really long waiting. I waited for nearly two hours. But other than that PERFECT PLACE. PERFECT FOOD|positive
Rated SpiceKlub is a pure veg joint located just opposite phoenix mills. It certainly seems to have put its foothold in the culinary circles as the manager claimed to have reservations made weeks in advance. It took about 2 hours to get a table here which added more to the curiosity of the cuisine served . Tried the nanzaa , papads of India,panipuri, galaouti kabab, vada pav,mango on the rocks, masala mojito, pan mousse and rasgulla cheescake. Nanzaa is a indianised version of the pizza. The galaouti kabab was true to its repute and matched in taste to its non veg counterpart. A special mention has to be made of the deconstructed vada pav which was a unique experience in itself.The testube panipuri was fun but it was more abt the presentation rather than taste. Papads of india was an assortment of regional papads to munch along with the food. Mango on the rocks was averagish and so was masala mojito which resembles panipuri water in ice. Pan mousse and rasgulla cheescake were excellent and a must have at this joint. Spice klub excels in the presentation and westernization of normal indian delicacies and that is its usp.|positive
Rated Loved spice klub. Being a vegetarian I love going to pure veg places that serve food with a twist since you get such a vast menu to choose from �? The naanza was the amazing .Tried the pav bhaji fondue which was a bit different so worth a try..For dessert we had the soap one which was very tasty.Although I saw the kulfi dessert on Instagram it looked interesting too �?|positive
Rated Good presentation of food. Ambience 7/10. You find mumbai food served in a royal way - panipuri's pani is served in test tubes and emali ka paani in injection and pav bhaji is depict in fondues. Pav-vada is always served in a very different way. Its quite expensive. Must try bubbling khulfi ,it's something unique served with 4-5 dips. Khulfi is -5°. Over all 4/5. Group meals is a better option. Valet available.|positive
Rated Touted as "the place" to go for the vegetarians, we decided to pay this place a visit along with the family. Being a weekend, we were given a waiting time of one hour. We were tempted to go to Riso / Ithaca during this time but decided to stick with our initial choice. We were seated in a booth after an hour and were instantly given the menus. Paani Puri is recommended in a lot of reviews and we decided to order it. Needless to describe the presentation since the place is known for the molecular gastronomy concept and the decoration of their dishes. My mother loved the paani puri primarily because of the rich flavor of phudina present in the paani. I liked it too, although I mixed quite a bit of sweet chutney to it. We also ordered Paneer Lapeta, Vegetable and Beetroot Spheres, Nannza, Pav Bhaji Fondue. Nannza was probably the best dish out of all of them and is strongly recommended. The fondue was good too although a bit cheesy in it's flavor. For desserts, we ordered Pan Mousse. They bring a pan in which we pour liquid over the pans and there's a lot of smoke without fire (pun intended). We were to eat it after a minute and we did. Again, pretty average for a dessert. Have had much much better desserts elsewhere. Coming to the management, I think they can do much much better in this section. The staff is warm and friendly advising how to consume dishes one after another, but takes a lot of time to serve the dishes. We ordered two dishes together and the second dish came after 20 mins of finishing the first dish. On multiple occasions the waiter seemed to forget the order and kept going back to the kitchen. I would say I was pretty disappointed by the whole experience since most of the people said the place is a heaven for vegetarians. I believe the place is extremely good for photography (what with all their fancy presentations and garnishing), but just about at par with any average restaurant in terms of taste and experience.|positive
Rated My experience here was so amazing that I went here back to back twice and I'm looking forward to visiting it again. We tried a lot of dishes and particularly liked the innovative attitude towards the traditional Indian dishes. The kadhi soup was thick and delicious amd was accompanied by crunchy fried mini bhajiyas on the side. The papads of India had a delectable spread of crispies. However, some of these were way too spicy and got me all teary eyed very soon. The mini golas were good and the rose Syrup dip was the best. For appetizers, we ordered the following: pav bhai fondue - a welcome change in the traditional pav bhaji it was a thick and cheesy fondue with an Indian twist deconstructed vada pav -this was perhaps the star appetizer, especially because off the dry red chutneys in edible plastic packets. Yes u read that right, edible plastic! nanzza - as the name suggests, it was a pizza with the base of an Indian man. The generous dose of cheese makes you want just more dahi ke Kebab - Curd patties with Mint Curd spherification. They just melt in the mouth and the small Curd spheres burst to release the creaminess of Curd and the freshness of mint. All the four dishes were spectacular and are a must try. For the main course, we ordered the amritsari vadi which was too spicy again and I couldn't enjoy it much. We'd also had the day makhani and it was delicious with butter oozing out in every morsel. For the desserts, we had the flower pot - everything except the plate is edible. The spoons have caramel filling, the pot itself is made of chocolate and has a sweet mousse filling below all the chocolate soil. The bubbling kulfi - it was simply mind blowing. It was served in an open flask with kulfi crumbles right above liquid nitrogen and was accompanied by caramel, chocolate, blueberry and rabdi Sauce as well as Raspberry caviar. This dessert was an entire carnival in itself. Rasgulla Cheesecake - it was colorful and tasted as good as it looked. And besides, rasgulla and cheesecake are just the two right things that can never go wrong when combined! Ambience: 3.5/5 Service: 4.5/5 Food: 4.5/5 Price: 4/5|positive
Rated I have been far from a regular Veg eater. When my friends brought me to SpiceKlub I wasnt convinced on why they want to mentally piss me off. The restaurant is not tough to miss. Bang opposite phoenix, the logo almost resembles an operating system logo :P The interiors are delicate, calming. The food is where everything about my perception changed. The deconstructed theme is brilliant ! The Kokam Caviar sweet and spicy juice , The Wada pav with wada moose and chutney in plastic like edible starch covering , The Liquid Nitrogen poured over Meetha Paan, The Paav Bhaaji fondue ! ; everything was bloody amazing. This is a MUST TRY for everyone. The first veg restaurant I really admire.|positive
Rated Located in the Phoenix Mills parking lot, BBC has a mixed fare for food options, from very Indian dishes to pizza to English dishes. We tried three things, The veggie pizza which was pretty good, the chicken cigar rolls, which were pretty much mozzarella cheese+herbs+ chicken fried, and white owl beer. We'd recommend the pizza!|positive
Rated I love the ambiance of the British Brewing Company, the techno savy Menu, the beer barrels is quite attractive. Had been there on a lazy Saturday afternoon after a movie. The place is lively with good music and crowd. The view from this place is good. We had ordered the 'Sex on the beach' cocktail and Chicken tikka pizza. The quantity is good to serve two people and the quality was good. The service was good and the staff was friendly.|positive
Rated Just to escape from the heat outside, we entered this cool place. That's the decision we are never going to regret. This place is big and comfortable, with friendly staff. We ordered garlic bread, bruchetta, wild forest pizza, etc. Everything was awesome, will surely visit this place again.|positive
Rated Had gone on a monday afternoon with office colluegues...opted for a fixed menu @490 plus taxes...one soup..one salad...n one main course...quantity is good for one person and the presentation of food... quality of food...flavours of food is just excellent... also ordered Tiramisu which was yummy too... Overall great deal and satisfying... happy stomach... happy me...|positive
Rated High ceilings, intricate interiors, grunge look, good beer, perfect ambience for a lazy lunch. But the food isn't something you'll wanna visit them for. To add to that, the service on the day we visited this place, was a complete disappointment. We were being attended by someone who didn't usually take care of the 'orders' and he happened to bungle up most things. What's nice about the place though is the fact that you can opt for a fixed set menu (if you are a light eater) or for a la carte. Its also fancy - they give you these ipads to place your orders but you gotta have patience to order on it. None of the items we ordered were anything we'd rave about. But the quantity of the food is totally noteworthy - one main dish should suffice for a person with a medium to heavy appetite. Overall, a chiller place to hang with friends on a friday night post work and order some finger foods.|positive
Rated Great beer. Slightly overpriced. True to the name, a very British setting- intricate interiors and high ceilings. Along with Irish house, the best place to chill in palladium mall.|positive
Rated This place situated in Palladium lower Parel got a really nice view of the mall. It is a 2story place with a lively ambiance with a center bar and an adjacent smoking room. This place brewers it's own beers and sells them, alongside other local and imported beers. So they don't have menus but these pads with their app on it with the entire menu from where you can order from. Very convenient! So we went on a Thursday evening.. And got the last table available there.. Lucky us.! We started of with brewed beers (I had the apple cider beer) and fish fingers with tarter sauce as starters which wer made with fresh basa fish and fried to perfection. We then had bangers with spiced potatoe mash.. It's a dish consisting of 3 different sausages, delicious silky mash and veggies tossed with chopped garlic in olive oil! Very fresh, very tasty.. Simple ingredients delicious dish.(definitely a must try) Lastly we had the buffalo steak.. Which was juicy and perfectly cooked with veggies on the side. Its got a good vibe goin with its f&b staff headed by the manager Mr. Yohanne Adil Mistry giving excellent spot on service! Ambiance : 3.5/5 Taste wise: 4.5/5 Service: - 5/5|positive
Rated Visited BBC last night with a group of friends. The decor and ambiance of the place is really nice and gives you the feel of sitting in a British pub! A really nice selection of music as well with a mix of music from the '70s and '80s. Another positive feature is their hi-tech method of taking orders. Orders are placed on a tab which lists out an extensive menu. The food took a little longer to arrive than we would have liked, but tasted good. Portions were of a decent size and I would recommend the All-Meat Fiesta Pizza. Also had a Lamb Sizzler which could have done with a touch more gravy I believe (just to cater to Indian sensibilities). Prices are competitive given that this outlet is located at High Street Phoenix. Overall a good experience and I hope to visit again in the near future!|positive
Rated Located on Level 4 at The Palladium, Ambience is alright types, nothing extraordinary , a notch lower than the Goregaon one. The ordering activity is a nice experience, through a Tab, they come to your table to confirm the order after you order via the tab. However, does not alwyas work to perfection Veg platter is alright, Service is just about okayish. One will have to keep calling for someone to get things. The Doolleganger draught beer is nice, Nice place to just Chill after work, have a drink I will however prefer the Goregaon one which has a more of Sports bar kind of ambience, the place is more buzzing, the expanse of the restaurant is much better there.|positive
Rated One of the best places for a casual drinking plans. Great spirits and amazing food. Hardly anything negative about it. The nachos were quite bland and so were the potato wedges. The pizza was really out of this world. They have amazing spread of food and drinks especially spirits. The cocktails were good. We tried cosmopolitan and it was great. The place is huge and the crowd is great. The tables are well spread for Mumbai standards. Definitely try it. U will return.|positive
Rated I am very good at catching vibes and this place had something! The feel in the air was something different. Colaba has very much English influence in its layout, architecture and everything. This place also speaks of the old time and also the atrocity that it faced in 2008. Now comes the food- its pretty decent- You can easily go for Italian. We didn't like the chili potato much. But the chocolate brownie managed to win our hearts like anything. If you want to sit at a calm place, then this one is not for you, because its always filled with crowd. And you will also have to stand in queue for washroom during peak hours(giggle). This one is perfect for a break while you shop at colaba. arunsingh2016.wordpress.com|positive
Rated My go to place whenever i'm in Colaba. Specially after a tiring session of shopping who doesn't enjoy some food and beer!! Quick service and real good food. The ambience is interesting plus you get the feel of being at a legendary place.|positive
Rated There are times when you you don't know it but you Land up at just the perfect place. Saturday night in Mumbai can be real hustle to get place to stand let alone a table ! Leopold's wasn't our first option but out of some really good luck we walked right in ! Didn't have to wait a minute ! Walked straight up and on to a table. The place which I've been to ample number of times has rarely ever disappointed and I was glad it didn't today either. Had to prove to a couple of friends from out of Mumbai why this is one of Our cities legendary place ! The ambience is lovely. Some really good stickers and posters on the wall and really good music to go along with your evening. And off course we didn't go to Leopold's to eat food. It's always been the place to go to enjoy the beer tower ! Beer served in a tower just makes it more interesting :D . Enjoyed a few beer towers along with the salted peanuts and the cheesling ( both complimentary :D). I couldn't resist myself and had to order the Buffalo burger. I wasn't sure how hungry I was until I had my first bite and didn't even realise that it took me less than 5 mins to finish it off. The thing with a good burger is that you cherrish every bite you take and it surely made me do that. I've always loved going to this place and will surely be going there soon enough ! :D|positive
Rated Last week we were in bombay for some official tour and on the last night of our stay we went to roam the southern part of mumbai and what best place you will go other then the most famous The Leopold cafe. I have been there so many times when i was living in Bombay, to recall our memories. Whenever you go there so much crowd and you always have to write your name in the waiting list. By this people can be able to know how favourite this place is. We ordered veg tofu and chicken with draught beer. Service is as always as fantastic and we spent quality time after a long time. Its always a must visit place in south Mumbai.|positive
Rated Ambience: Leopold Café is more than just a cafe or restaurant or restobar. It is the legacy of Mumbai. Located on a busy Colaba Street famous for Street shopping, it is always crowded. South Bombay is famous for its architecture, for its culture and thus has a regal feel to it. Leopold Cafe also signifies all of these. Interestingly, the place has no music and they have retained the ambience from years to keep the classic feel to it. You feel happy here as it has a lotta positive vibes. Coming to the drinks: I strongly recommended their draft beer. You may opt for beer by the glass, by the pitcher (that serves atleast 4 beer mugs) or even their Beer Tower - recommended for large groups that serves 8-10 glasses. Food: We ordered Tandoori Chicken - which I felt was a bit dry to taste unlike the juicy expectation. Wasn't very happy with it but then again this isn't a formal dining place so I wouldn't complain much. We also ordered for their famous Chicken fried rice - amazing preparation with the right amount of salt and chunks of chicken. Even the chicken gravy served with it was nice, however again, I've had better. Hospitality: The staff here is very friendly so that's a huge plus point. Friendly environment, cheerful places, very cool. Vfm: very well priced so very good value for money indeed. Overall a great experience with my best friends Santosh Bangar Sneha Kolambkar B Positive Vibhor Tikiya divyatikiya.wordpress.com|positive
Rated One of the most famous landmarks of mumbai ! Oldest cafes of mumbai ! Very nice place & Gud ambience! Went with my frnz to hv beer .. It ws really a nice experience! I luved the vintage look it has .. Must visit recommended.|positive
Rated I have heard of this place a lot before. The terrorist activity and the bullet marks have certainly increased the hype about this place. This place is located at Colaba, famous for its ethnicity and traditional cuisine. I can't remember where in Earth I had so delicious Dry Chilli chicken. Chinese or Mughlai Cuisine with their famous drought tower are must have in this place. Will surely revisit :)|positive
Rated Below average expirence as I visited this place to have couple of chilled beers. It was a @hot summer evening and place was over crowded even in non a.c area. The beer bottle wasn't that chilled and once they opened it niether they kept it in the fridge nor did they have a ice bucket where I can keep my bottle. I ended up having my bottle almost like a room temperature. Food wasn't that grt too.|positive
Rated The terrorist activity and the (in)famous bullet marks have certainly increased the hype about this place. Ambience is good. Service is prompt too. The fact that it's always buzzing with activity makes it a good place to hang out. Food is decent - sufficient quantity for the price they charge. However, their hot apple pie was worth a try.|positive
Rated First time n best time..Liked the food as it was awesome and tasty.. had a drink called Electric lemonade which was soothing and cool..caramel custard is wat I loved d most...yummylicious|positive
Rated one of the gems of mumbai to have authentic mughlai food..can try pretty much anything (that should sum up all what I have to say)..in rotis especially try the khasta roti and tawa paratha..simply superb..|positive
Rated 13th February, 2016 Summary: Another legendary institution in South Mumbai, managed by the Mansuri family. Die hards swear by its mutton dum biryani, kababs & Dal Makhani. I can vouch totally for the Daal plus it's Gajar Halwa. Reasonable pricing, in fact lesser than some of the Chembur restaurants & hence more value for us Chemburities. This review & rating while still a honest effort on my own, I must state for readers the restaurant had invited me through Zomato marketing team with a complimentary voucher worth xxx. Saturday lunch with my boys, we UBER to Causeway by 1250. Delhi Darbar is a red bricked restaurant standing in the busy Main Street since 1973. We are ushered in by the manager himself as I had reserved a table confirming use of their letter through Zomato. It has a floor level above, we seat into the lower ground level. It's already crowded. Low ceiling, dim lighting. Few paintings on the walls. A few Bohri Muslim elders tucking heartily at their murg tikkas beside our table while on the opposite end done Angrezi ladies having Naan with curries. I am recommended to try their Murg Tangdi while my boys have the standard Paneer Tikka. The Tangdi (8.5/10) is 2 big pieces of meat well tandoored and not too much colouring or masala. The onion slivers marinated in vinegar is excellent with the spicy dark coriander chutney. Add some lemon juice I suggest. The boys think the paneer tikka (8.5/10) is ok, my younger son our expert on paneer feels it can be more softer. We have Veg Makhanwala (8/10) & Dal Makhni (9.5/10) with rotis & roomali. My elder son goes for the Veg biryani (8/10), Nicely flavoured rice with heaps of masala gravy mixed within the bottom layers. The raita (8.5/10) is very thick & refreshing, so much he asks for another serving. The Daal Makhni I must say is outstanding, as good as the one in ITC Peshawri. Creamy, smooth, gingery & buttery. The veg subzi has good amount of cashews & carrots. I felt it can have more gravy and needed a garlic zing. We end up with Gajar Ka Halwa (9.5/10), melt in the mouth with generous use of ghee, khoya ( don't think they cheat here using condensed milk) & dry fruits. Even junior who hates Mithai had a spoon hearing our Aahs & Oohs. We finish just before two pm, the restaurant now has a wait list outside the door. So much for the traditionalists. I have rated it 3.5/5, nothing wrong with it but other than the dal & Mithai DD is another good standard Mughlai eatery for us all. And a big thank you to Zomato marketing & the Mansuri family for the invite with a complimentary meal value amount. Shukriya ...now where the hell is our UBER !!!!|positive
Rated Located in the busy and lively lanes of Colaba, this is a must-try for anyone who visits the area or nearby. Having its presence in Mumbai as well in the hearts of foodies, this restaurant specializes in Mughlai and North Indian cuisine. Easy to locate , after reaching we found it to be too crowded and were asked to wait outside. Almost after half an hour, we were taken inside and seated on the 1st floor of the restaurant. It was jam-packed in a weekday evening. We did not mind waiting for what we got served afterwards. We ordered their signature dishes like Chicken Dum Biryani and Butter Chicken along with other items to go with it. The Biryani was nice cooked and was less oily, mildly spiced and chicken pieces were soft and tender. One of the best Biryanis I have ever tasted in my life. Coming to Butter Chicken, that's like heavenly experience of juicy tender chicken getting melted in your mouth. The service was fast and the staff was courteous. The rates are quite reasonable given the quality, taste and quantity of the food. I am not a native of Mumbai, but if given a chance will again visit just to have another round of Biryani and Butter Chicken. Ever since my 1st visit, have been recommending all my friends and relatives to try this place at least once.|positive
Rated Amazing experience... had their dabba gosht... so yumm... in fact, it was suggested by the manager there as we wanted boneless mutton. This dish is a combination of soft boneless mutton and egg... we had tandoor roti along with this curry. On desserts, we ordered gajar ka halwa... was served hot. Liked this one as well...|positive
Rated yummilicious..... yes thts the word for the food served at this place.. we started with a delicious Chicken manchaw soup.. followed with Chicken tikka masala... the quality and the freshness of chicken can be felt by the touch of it...so soft and fresh...and rumali roti was so soft ...it just melts in your mouth.....guys dnt miss the Biryani here... yes the claim which this people make abt mumbai's best biryani is really true... ur meal is incomplete with having Delhi Darbar Biryani...HIGHLY Recommended...|positive
Rated This place is just amazing! The food is too good! One must try mutton amd chicken biryani. The lamb is very soft and well cooked! The service is fast and ambience is also good! Recommended|positive
Rated Meh! The outlet has such an imposing structure but as soon as you walk in, the interiors are just very sad. They have two separate parts and I believe only one of them seems decent enough. I wish they'd revamp the interiors. The food is good though, no doubt about that; the softest lamb I have ever had! We had the salli boti and like I said, it was delicious. We also ordered the bheja fry and chicken tikka masala. I have never been a fan of bheja fry and their dish didn't change that either. The chicken was good but damn, 4-5 tiny pieces of chicken in a kadai of gravy? C'mon man. The quantity is disappointing. Can't say I would choose to go back a second time.|positive
Rated A very hyped place I would say at the least. Delhi Darbar is located near Regal cinema in Colaba. Large space, well built and good interiors. The menu also looked good and well covered in terms of mughlai dishes. We ordered a lot of stuff including kebabs, main course, biryani and desserts but the quantity was below expectations. Taste was decent but not at all close to what one gets in Delhi. Biryani, which they pride, was certainly the stand out. The only problem which was disturbing and irritating at the same time was the attitude of their servers. They were blunt and argued over a certain order. I urge their management to take care of that. Overall it was a satisfactory experience. Ambiance: 3.5/5 Food: 4/5 Service: 2.5/5|positive
Rated The food is fantastic. The Mutton Biriyani is succulent and very tasty. The service was also good. The quantity for the Tandoori platter was too little, not good value for money on that one, but overall great food.|positive
Rated My absolute favourite, love the pizza out here, the taste is still the same from years, the best is the Bombay masala pizza, also love the garlic bread with cheese. Has a great location overlooking the queens necklace.|positive
Rated It was Saturday evening when we reached this place and luckily easily got a table for 6. I loved the original place - Jazz by the bay but that was more of a night place whereas this is great anytime. Ambience: 5/5 The décor and setup is very European with glass walls such that your seating is overlooking the sea. The natural light Nd open view add to the charm of sitting in South Mumbai. The indoor is also nice with fine dining and a much more formal setup alongwith the bar. Food n Drinks: 1. Veg Supremo and Super Supreme - half and half pizza: one of the best pizzas I've had for sure. Since we were 2 Vegetarians and 2 non vegetarians, we preferred half n half. The veg side had almost all kinds of toppings - olives, tomato, jalepeno, corn and so much cheese!! Every bite was heavenly and so very filling! Even the super supreme had a variety of chicken as well as pork topping. And once again the topping looked so heavy, it was falling off from the thin crust. For the first time I would say for a pizza - Dil se banaya tha! 2. We then ordered for white sauce spaghetti pasta with crunchy garlic bread on the side: This was soooo creamy, hot and awesome. The quantity was small I thought, or maybe because everyone hogged onto it. The spaghetti was well cooked, cream sauce was also delicious and not at all bland. 3. No, we were not done with this. Our final order was their paneer pizza: again, thin crust pizza with topping of chunks of panner, mushroom and jalepeno. Very heavy topping, no kanjoosi here. Well, for the amount they charge they can't afford to act cheap. 4. Drinks: Two of us opted for their famous detox drinks : orange flavor and beetroot flavor. They were very refreshing, very attractive, very healthy and very tasty. We also tasted their Long island Iced Tea - brilliant. I only tasted so can't comment further than that. Overall it was definitely an awesome experience. Yes, the price is very high but the quantity and quality makes it worth while. You can be sure that food will be good so paying a price for this certainty is fine with me. Sneha Kolambkar B Positive Santosh Bangar Vibhor Tikiya divyatikiya.wordpress.com|positive
Rated Just around the corner of Marine Drive. A place getting iconic by itself with time. A place where you would rush to catch a seat in the open section as it is the one place where from you can either sit alone or with your near & dear ones and keep looking at the queens necklace all through and the cool breeze passing by. Now coming to the food their Bombay Masala is famous and yes why not they have maintained the taste and quality all through. Had order with a chicken topping on it and loved it as pizza was crispy and the chicken well cooked. The base of the sauce had the flavors coming out well. The next in order was the cheese garlic bread. It is different from the rest and yumm to its best. It's layers of cheese pushed inside the bread and baked to perfection. You can't stop with a bite and can't order more than one as it is filing by itself. The smoked tomato basil soup is another favorite dish of mine right from the days of the its erstwhile brand talk of the town why as it always reminds me of the same flavors. The taste of basil and herbs comes out very well. A soup which i relish and don't get any where else. Service top notch right from the valet to the manger to the service team. Hats of to each one of them. I am surely going back again, actually wait a moment I always have kept going and would not change on that. PS - do try their lunch buffet it's awesome with a big spread to choose from on soup salad sandwich and off course dessert|positive
Rated Alphonso mango shake & the sundried tomato & chicken pizza is to die for. Awesome location & Awesome food. A must try place ......loved it.|positive
Rated Loved this one! One of my favourites in Mumbai now. Heard good things and they were all true when I visited. I paid them 2 consequtive visits on my trip to Mumbai. Melon Martini sounded so yum and it was! Do try the Bombay Masala on the pizza menu. Tiramisu was by far the best I had till date. Just a bit disappointed with the ambience otherwise it goes for a 5.|positive
Rated Formerly known as Pizzeria or Jazz by the bay. This pizza joint gives amazing thin crust pizzas! Though I miss Jazz by the bay being a big fan of live music, this place feels the same. Very blissful as light breeze blows from the marine drive.|positive
Rated We've tried the Bombay Masala Pizza and in no way found it spectacular. Definitely not worth the listing on the Gourmet pizza collection but then to each his own!! The service is decent. The place is excruciatingly expensive given its location and the view is breathtaking! Ideal for a date for two! thefoodauror.blogspot.com|positive
Rated Initially this place was called Jazz by the bay, and over the years it changed to pizza by the bay. I used to go here a lot in my childhood and went here after really long to relive some of those memories. This place is done up well(much better than what it was before.) They have inside and outside seating. If it's post evening time you must sit outside, it gives you a very different feeling. Also you get a spectacular view of Marine Drive! They staff and service here are decent but the food is good but not as good as before. I ordered for their famous Bombay Masala pizza( my all time favourite) and for jalapeño cheese poppers. Both were good and I enjoyed my visit here after a long time. Hopefully should visit soon!|positive
Rated A happy and satisfied customer after repeatedly ordering their Fish/Chicken/Green Curry/Basil sauce woks. Even the medium portion is sufficient for a foodie like me and the food is served hot and tasty. 250 bucks for it might be a little costly but you will be left happy and contented after eating.|positive
Rated The wok here is really hyped up. I tried the Chicken Basil pao and a chicken wok with Kung pao sauce. The sauce was very strong and overpowering. The bao was too sweet and the caramalised onions just made it sweeter. There was no balance of flavours in any of the dishes.|positive
Rated A perfect place when u want to have a meal,they have Thai,Chinese pricing is a little on a higher side if u compare to other fast food outlets offering wok's. I tried their green Thai which was marvellous ,the crispy ginger was good and the filing of chicken in both was adequet! The magic pepper sauce was was spicy as mentioned but I fell it was overly spiced than only tasty!!! Bubble teas are nice and taste well. The box has lids but for my convenience I cut off the sides as in the photo attached!!|positive
Rated Nice place to try out Chinese food. We tried: 1. Wok box - Soba Noodles and Chilli Basil - was yum!!!! 2. Spicy Chicken Sriracha Dumpling - was awesome!!! 3. Sriracha Surprise Dumpling - was bit too spicy!!! Love what they have done to the place. They didn't over do it but it is a nice place. Do visit around 9pm or else it becomes bit overcrowded.|positive
Rated Its pretty good food on a budget. I ordered the sriracha chicken dumplings , the chicken jalapeno peanut bao and a prawn wok box in coconut curry. It was really good, didn't expect it to b delicious especially the dumplings. It's amazing food if u r on a budget|positive
Rated Chinese food has always been my best friend. I can eat it for every meal and will never get tired of it. Sometimes I feel that they add some special ingredient to it as it always makes me want more. I often wonder how this place survives with its tough competitor – 5 Spice just right beside it but I’m guessing it does have a charm of it’s own that makes it stand out! It was a surprisingly, pleasant evening and I decided to have an early dinner. Neither of us could eat too much so we shared. What really got me excited was their whole concept of making your own wok. It’s become such a hit everywhere you go! And it was to my advantage as I love anything that is customized. I feel it’s more personal and something I can relate to more. Making my own wok meant that it had all my favourites in it so I was one happy gastronome. The décor is funky and creates a lovely ambiance especially if you’re hanging out with a couple of mad-hatter friends. It consists of bar stools and long wooden tables with black walls in the background. It also gives it that whole retro feel. It is self-service and the most fun part is that you get to watch the guy make your wok. You get to choose your own base (steamed rice/ udon noodles/ flat wheat noodles/ ramen noodles) , meat (chicken/fish/prawn) ,veggies( leeks/ button mushrooms/spring onion/ baby cabbage/ baby corn/ carrot/ broccoli/ zucchini/ onion/ pak choy/tofu/peppermix/ french beans/ cauliflower) , sauces( black bean/ black pepper/ kung pao/ chilli basil/ ohn khao suey/ oyster sauce/ pumpkin curry/teriyaki/ thai curry/ sambal/ toban) and condiments(fried onions/ crushed peanuts/ burnt garlic/ cliantro) image I went with: Base- steamed rice Meat- chicken Veggies- leeks,mushrooms, baby corn , broccoli, zucchini,tofu Sauce- teriyaki Condiments- fried onions, crushed peanuts, burnt garlic I really enjoyed the combination of flavours in my mouth and each flavour was so distinct. I could get the strong sweetness from the sauce and it was well balanced with the toppings and other elements. What I was most pleased was the fact that it was overloaded with biog chunks of chicken pieces. It was definitely worth it! The boxes that they come in are simply adorable and the guys will also redo it for you in case you are not happy with what has been served. Next on my list was the Har gau(prawn) dumplings. I have always been a huge fan of dimsums be it any kind. I also find them a much healthier option at least when you’re eating out but sadly these did not live up to my expectations. They had a glossy casing covering a jumbo prawn and sat looking so dainty.They were light and fresh but I wouldn’t vouch for these. It was a real disappointment because they are my favourite kind any day! Another major disappointment were the latest addition of baos that everyone has been raving about! The baos had a very weird texture. Seemed like they didn't have the right proportion of yeast and the filling that consisted of Chicken in Peanut sauce and Jalapeños wasn't very appetizing either. I guess sometimes I'm just unlucky with food. To end it, was a fortune cookie that spoke about the future of my life. Wok Express is a casual, chilled out place that you could try when you’re bored of the usual home food or just want an outing. It’s not the next Yauatcha or China Gate so don’t go expecting anything fancy. Now comes the most important question: Would I go there again? Not so sure… maybe just for the woks actually! (The author dined anonymously and paid for her own meal) yummyinsidemytummy.in|positive
Rated Absolutely ga-ga over this place...simple clean neat wooden interiors with bar stools and wooden tables, just grab your Customised Wok with Rice/ Noodles, protein, veggies, sauces, toppings like fried onions/peanuts/garlic and sit down for a casual meal. The bubble tea was different and quite liked it. But the wok is the true hero, dont be fooled by its size as its quite enough for 2 people to share. We tried the one with Chilli Coriander Sauce & Hot Garlic Sauce, both were great. Need to make more visits here to try the dumplings and the Baos. The Fortune cookies at the end of the meal is a fun thing, you feel like a child curious to read what the fortune cookie has in store for you.|positive
Rated Ordered veg ramen noodles in hot crispy garlic sauce(medium), prawns with rice in chilli basil sauce(large), chicken chill basil bao, milo-tella and pink guava ice tea. The noodles were very saucy and good. The non veg rice we ordered had very less prawns in it didn't like it much. The drinks were okay. The chicken bao was very tasty loved it will surely go next time especially for it. A bit pricy but will definitely try some dimsums next time.|positive
Rated Amazing food. Flavours are always consistent. The bubble tea is delicious. New massaman curry is nice and I love the new wheat soba noodles! Great place to order from or walk in and eat. Staff is super nice and super kind. One of my favourite places to just sit down and grab a proper delicious healthy meat and veggie filled meal!|positive
Rated Love this place for one thing and one thing alone, their Edamame Truffle Oil dumplings; they're so subtly delicious and melt-in-the-mouth! Priced at Rs.250+tax for four pieces, I find them quite reasonable too. The crystal dumplings are good but they come nowhere close to the legendary crystal dumplings we had at Lemon Leaf, which shuttered recently :( Other things worth trying here are the Baos, steamed Chinese breads with various fillings. The Woks are quite average and too heavily doused in sauce. The Bubble Tea is.. meh! They can do better.|positive
Rated I'm totally in love with this place. Unusual decor with some colour full objects all around really brighten up this small cute place. Food is just amazing- eggs are a must try, chicken sandwich with fresh multigrain bread is sumptuous! Definitely try the sangria and their yummy shakes variety. I really wish they open an outlet soon in town😑|positive
Rated A nice quaint little place. Stands out in that area full of bars and shisha joints. The food here is simple yet tasty - they have a stuffed leg of chicken which is delicious however their omelette is quite boring - it's one of the simplest things to make maybe thus taken for granted. It could definitely be much much better. The location is central however blends into the adjoining places and is difficult to find. The decor is very cute and I love the books placed in the shells. Tables and couches can be cleaner, especially because guests come out to eat for an experience. Food is great, decor is fab, hygiene and maintainance can be much better. A one time visit for sure :)|positive
Rated Young! yes, this is the word that comes to mind when you visit Jamjar Diner. Ambience of this place is the selling point. I visited this place with a friend. This is a cool place to hang out. The good food is like a topping.|positive
Rated Really nice decor and decent food. Heard that night time ambience here is better. Liked the pasta and drinks here. Unique wall decor and collectibles. Really a must try place.|positive
Rated Jamjar a very vibrant blue color entrance greets you to the restaurant, the entrance really gets your attention if you pass by this place. A get together with friends and Jamjar was the place decided for the meet. It has a very cosy and calm ambiance and a rooftop section as well, but we settled for the AC section as it can accommodate a large group. There is a jukebox placed in a corner. -Food- Chicken Popcorn - The chicken popcorn was good with crisp layer and it got over in no time. Spicy Harrisa Chicken - The chicken made in harrisa paste served with creamy dip, but it wasn't spicy and lacked flavor. The dish was average in taste. Chili Cheese Toast - The toast was very good with melted cheese and olives on top and it was yum. Fire Roasted Veggies Taco - The veggies tossed in olive oil and roasted and served in small tortillas. A huge thumps up for this dish. Pizza Basil Pesto Chicken - This thin crust Pizza was good with the chicken pieces done in pesto sauce with olives toppings. Chimichurri Grilled Chicken - The chicken breast marinated and grilled and served with herb sauce, mashed potatoes and veggies. The grilled chicken was cooked to perfection and delectable. Pizza Feta and Roasted Pepper - One of the worst Pizza I ever had. The thin crust was fine, with feta cheese, roasted pepper and olives topping. The pizza was very bland in taste. Pan tossed Broccoli & Mushroom - This dish was a big let down. Virgin Mojito - This drink is somewhat default for me �? one of the best I had so far. It was a dry day so my friends missed out on the cocktails. So, overall it was a decent experience with some hits and misses. The food is just above average. The portion served is good and service is prompt. A good place to chill out with your friends.|positive
Rated This place has been promoting itself on Zomato for a while now, so it definitely had my attention. As I was in Versova one morning, I visited Jamjar. I was pleasantly surprised as I entered, because it surpassed my expectations. As the meal progressed, my excitement toned down, and at the end of it, I can say that it's a lovely place but is it really that special? I doubt it. Service: Quite nice. They provided themselves at all times, and though a little unprofessional, they always dispensed their duties successfully. But yet again, I can't say with confidence that it was excellent service. Maybe I'm being over critical. Ambience & Décor: Free Jukebox. Enough said. The place is beautiful. It's absolutely adorable. They've really gone all out and made sure Jamjar Diner is unique. The ambience, I can't really say much for, since we were the only ones there in the morning. But I can't imagine it being anything but good. Food: CHICKEN CAESAR SALAD. Firstly, I'm hugely disappointed in the sheer lies, pertaining to the healthy food they provide. Apart from few salads, nothing feel under that category. So I chucked the diet, and dug in. Chicken was magnificent. It was light, and had a great flavour. The leaves were good too. Normally, Caesar Salads are drenched in dressing, thankfully this was lightly dressed. Well made. MUSHROOM MELT SANDWICH. Pretty decent. The bread was average, but the mushrooms were nice (although a little bigger than ideal). The sauce in which were the mushrooms, was gorgeous. It was spicy and tangy. Sadly, very little cheese. The side salad was nice. SPICED PEAR BROWNIE SUNDAE. Very innovative with the pears, I really enjoyed them, but there could've been. The brownie was alright, as was the Vanilla Ice Cream. Nothing too special. The Ice cream could've been pear flavoured. I'm not too sure how that would go with chocolate brownies, but the components of the dish weren't really congruent. GANGA JAMUNA JUICE. Freshly squeezed orange and sweet lime, and some sugar. Voilà! Pretty good. Slightly tangy, but if it's naturally made then I wouldn't complain. Jamjar Diner maybe is a special place after all. But it's far from perfect. It has set a good standard with respect to its Ambience & Décor, but the quality of service and especially food, could use some work. You'll still enjoy it, but will you cherish it? Go and find out.|positive
Rated First look from outside and I was vary of the place. Stepping inside i was awestruck ! A perfect place for brunch. In fact I revisited one night and sat outdoors and it was perfect then too! Ordered : Nutella banana pancakes Bbq burger(chicken and pork) Beef steak Spaghetti bolognese Honey chilli Pork Chicken skewers And the best of all : Jamjar jäger Long Island tea Each dish was yummy. Honey chilli pork was an experiment and it didn't disappoint Do try that drink The burger was my favorite : the bread was a little too big. When I mentioned this the chef corrected the second burger I would love to go here again and again!|positive
Rated A nice place for breakfasts and brunch days. Love their bacon and cheesy fries. The sangria is pretty neat! The beers are nice! You get to taste them before you make a decision. THEY HAVE A JUKEBOX!|positive
Rated I remember coming to this place when I was in school, but it was some other restaurant then. I like what they have done to it now. It got a nice ambience. Though I don't like the outdoor seating. It gets really hot outside. And the table in the right corner has too many plants right above your head. Sometimes theres smoke smell from the neighbourhood which can be irritating. And outside needs more lighting. As some pages of the menu has a dark background its hard to read the text when theres not enough light. Inside seating is way better. Service is pretty good too. Would visit this place again, but sit inside.|positive
Rated Food is just awesome, loved the Punjabi flavors. Love the pan shots served after meal. Was disappointed with the hygiene part, so not giving good rating, feel that they should maintain it. Spoons were very dirty and sticky.... It's a turnoff!!! They changed the cutlery though but still it did not meet my requirement. Guys please do something about it.. Because I love the food and ambiance..|positive
Rated Punjab is all about the rich culture, food and sprawling 'khets'. The best way to experience all of it is by taking your car out and going on a 'gedi' (drive) wherein the most anticipated moment is the pit stop to a dhaba and gorging on some culinary brilliance. Alas, this isn't Punjab which is why I went on a gedi where the dhaba wasn't a stop but a destination. This is how I ended up here, at Pratap's the dhaba. The restaurant provides you with a large open air dining area, like the typical dhaba, along with a smaller indoor dining hall that has the bar. The ambiance is akin to Haveli (popular restaurants in Punjab) hence you will get a glimpse of the Punjabi culture, with a hanging dhol to mannequins doing bhangra to the waiters dressed up in kurta pajamas and, the best part, Punjabi quips on the walls. The entire atmosphere was lively because of the peppy punjabi songs playing in the background that were making me laugh and baffling my non-Punjabi friends. I couldn't stop grinning when I was handed the menu because it was on a 'pakhkhi'(a handheld fan). The service here needs a little fixing because we had to do a lot of hand waving to catch the attention of the staff. Coming to the judgment of whether the flavours were as authetic as the ambiance had set it up to be? Well, almost. Read on. We ordered Bhalla Papri Chat which was essentially perfect with the chutneys and curd really hitting home. This dish raised my expectations really high that the flavours were going to be impeccable. Next were the gol gappes (or pani puri) which was a delight as I got to see the filling to potatos and black chickpeas after really long with the perfect imli chutney. I just wish that the 'pani' was more tangy. The Choora Papad was the dish that really made me want to call up mom because that's exactly how she does it: with a dash of chaat masala, red chilli and ghee. For the main course, we went for Dal makhani and Paneer Kadai Wala. The paneer was really well made with the slightly tangy base and soft paneer but lacked a little in the spicy department. The dal makhani, though, was an utter disaster. No matter which part of the globe it is, I cannot accept dal makhani that gives flavours of coconut! And that was exactly what was wrong with that dish and ruined all the fun for me. The naan and ajwain di roti were a little chewy but not bad either. The meal was really accentuated by the delectable onions and garlic. Even though I was disheartened post the dal makhani fiasco, the desserts did make up for it. We ordered the malai kulfi which was good but the winner was the jalebi rabri. Perfectly sweetened crunchy jalebis with the cool rabri really did save the day. The meal ended with complimentary paan shots that were a really refreshing culmination of our journey. Overall, I would recommend this place if you wish to catch a glimpse of Punjabi culture but the place is a little overpriced. I would love to go there again because I was eating good food while pseudo-dancing in my seat after a long time; so I can say that my gedi was successful.|positive
Rated Travellers who have been to the highway's in North India especially the Punjab belt would know of great tastes and ambience in dhaba's lining up alongside the road. Pratap Dhaba recreates the magic of taste punjabi cuisine right in the heart of Mumbai. The decor of the place is rustic and earthy like in Dhaba. The music and menu card compliments the Dhaba setup. I prefer non-veg food at this restaurant that is little spicy. Preference is the chicken (Kukkad) tandoori or chicken tikka. This restaurant serves fried fresh garlic as mini bites free of cost as it is one amazing thing to have with the drinks or meal. Also the onion is punched to break open like in villages. Such small gestures make the Dhaba more authentic and just like village homely atmosphere. After meal they serve pan shots, which is made of paan and instead of having paan one can do good with this paan shots. Some unique items to try is the Vodka Pani poori, Jalebi with Rabdi.|positive
Rated This used to be a very good restaurant for Punjabi cuisine. They have both indoor n outdoor seating. I've been here multiple times including couple of special occasions with family n friends. I've always sat outside in the open. The ambience is rustic village like. Yesterday's visit has made me change my opinion about Pratap's. First the table given to us had a very wet floor almost a puddle below the table. Luckly we got another one as the rest was not full. The food was very poor we'd ordered for Chicken Achari n Paneer Achari which was ok. Pani Puri also ok. Chicken Kalmari was very dry. The disappointment was with kaali daal which was not kaali at all n looked peeli with too much of cream in it. When we told the captain he's said it's like this only. Later he got it changed but there was not much difference. Daal makhni was so delicious once upon a time here. I guess their chef has changed n it's not good for the restaurant. Ambience - 3.5/5 Food - 2/5 Service - 3/5|positive
Rated complimentary bhuna garlic pods is what I look out for every time the food id ordered form here. The food is average. The ambience is nice and missi rotis are quite nice too.|positive
Rated The ambience is decent and they have tried hard to make it look like a dhaba. Food is excellent. Delicious food. Prices on the expensive side. Icing on the cake is the pan shot they give it in the end. All in all a good experience .|positive
Rated Over priced food.. We simply ordered for 2 large rum n a large blenders with one seekh kebab chicken n one pani puri with one mocktail and our bill was already 2.5k...super expensive for the flavor they deliver as nothing great just how the normal Punjabi hotels serve...I felt I have lot better options than prataps for Punjabi cuisine with a genuine pricing without burning a hole in pocket n so we then shifted to Masala Zone for main dinner as few more people were about to join us..n trust me my guests were delighted with Masala Zone... So until I want to purposely show off n splurge ain't goin back|positive
Rated Pratap the Dhaba is I great place to eat!!! I've been going here a while now and this place is one of those very consistent restaurants with its quality of the food! Hands down the dishes to order are: Butter chicken, Paneer Tikka, tandoori chicken and make sure you get those masala fried pieces of garlic with the pickled onions! (OMG!)! I could eat this everyday. The place has attentive staff, great vibe (what you expect of a high end Dhaba) and quick service. I highly recommend this place. Keep up the great food.|positive
Rated If there's any place in Bbay that sells honest to God authentic Punjabi food, then it's this place. I always thought it was an ok place while I got food delivered at home. After a tiring day I decided to stop over and grab a bite, right from the guy at the door to bearers all of them are warm and cordial. Now to the food tried only a few things on the menu but believe you me they were truly the best I have ever had - the butter chicken, dal makhni, with roti and jeera rice. The jalebi's we thin, crisp, piping hot and most importantly had jus the right amount of sweetness. If you are in Andheri and u wanna have Punjabi food think no further.|positive
Rated A really mouth watering experience.. Great pizzas..., one of the best in town. The pizzas are loaded with vegetables and chicken.. Great amount of cheese as well. The pizzas are really tasty and there are great offers on bulk orders. Have always ordered the pizzas from here and the delivery is done within 45 mins.|positive
Rated The rating is solely for the food. The service was so bad that I had to deduct the other 2.5. One goes out to eat in peace. But here, youre served anything but peace. From wrong orders to even 'wronger' orders, it will be a while before they get your pizza right. The food was nice though. Chicken kheema is strongly recommended for spice and meat lovers. The Veg. Mexican was delightful as well. A good place to order it home as well as its a welcome break from the usual dominoes. Some might say even better. Ambience - 5/10 Service - 2/10 Food - 8/10|positive
Rated One of the best pizza places ever. Also, one of the meatiest pizzas in town. Not a dine in as the place is small. But, take away and eat immediately for ultimate flavour. P.S. I RECOMMEND A VISIT OR A CALL|positive
Rated Eva's pizza is a nice little place that offers pizzas of Italian standards. You can order on phone, or choose to sit in their dugout near Marol. We ordered a Chicken Keema and a Veg Bonanza. The pizzas were bleeding cheese through its cuts when they arrived. Pricing is moderate, quality is supreme. Satisfaction level is 4 on 5!|positive
Rated This review is based on their food and delivery services 1) Food (0.75/1.25) : 2 of their pizzas - our dinner for a girl gang night out. I don't remember clearly what was ordered- but if I am not mistaken - one was Eva's special (chicken) and the other was probably a paneer pizza. They were both delivered hot - tasted rustic and had decent amount of proteins/meat on them. Did enjoy the pizzas and can't really pick out anything negative. It's just that I've had pizzas with at least 25% more toppings and some more flavour punch. 2) Service (1.25/1.25) : no complaints there 3) Innovation & Technique (0.25/1.25) : I am sure they will come up with something that is really unique to them - a Pizza roll/ a Pizza-nachos together may be? With other pizza joints doing really well in Mumbai - I am sure they will keep up their standards and keep getting better. 4) VFM (0.75/1.25) : 2 Large pizzas and the total bill was Rs.900/- Some more kick in the flavour of the pizzas - they would have been stunning!|positive
Rated Best pizzas ever. :) they have become our favourite outlet for ordering pizza in office. They have amazing offers and cheese burst is mouth wateringly yumm.|positive
Rated We have ordered from this place like multiple times. Can't say much about delivery, it's just same everywhere. Their pizza is definitely better than Domino's and the offer they give is something me and my colleagues look forward too. Cheaper than other pizza joint :)|positive
Rated It's a small joint in Marol but don't go by its interior! It serves Amazing pizzas loaded with cheese and toppings! We ordered chicken hurricane and BBQ chicken pizza. It was stuffed with chicken pieces! Definitely worth a try!|positive
Rated Between breads is a must for all gourmet fast food lovers, in fact it is fast food only in sense that it serves fries, subs and burgers, but it is nothing like your typical joint! Ingredients and buns are fresh, yummy, a healthy as they can get (for example ciabatta and multigrain) and with awesome combinations! My favorite sandwiches are roasted peppers, California veg, Philly (veg and non) the two very creative Soy Cheeseburger and Thai chicken burger; a special mention for Chef’s Farm Fresh and Mushroom and Chicken. All orders also come with fries or chips; as sides, fries and wedges are available in creative variants; I was also very amused to see that here even their desserts are subs! Unlike other fast food chains, staff is kind and prompt, place is clean and setting nicely decorated, with pleasant background music.|positive
Rated If you love huge subs or burgers, this is definitely a place to try out. Tasty food and good music. What I also love about this place is that they have a couple of archie comic books kept on each table. Nice concept.|positive
Rated Bacon fries. Need I say more?. Ok bacon strip's. Yup this place does exist. If you are a junk food lover, BB is the place to B. The burgers and the buns are juicy, tender and yumm. Almost everything on the menu is delicious. Wish the freakin beef ban never happened. The beef that was served here when this place started was a bomb.|positive
Rated My second visit to this place wasn't as good as the first one. The standard of the food has dropped considerable since I last visited it. The place seemed stuffy for some reason and a lot of things on the menu weren't available. I had fries, a chicken sandwich and a turkey sandwich which came along with chips, they were good and tasty no doubt, but they use to be better.|positive
Rated I must say very simple and impressive. I had the veg chilli lime pesto and lemon&herb fries and Arnold Palmer iced tea and it was one of the best hamburgers and fries I have had till date. Very hygienic and staff is very polite. The decor is good and gives a proper feel of the place. Highly recommended.|positive
Rated Between breads is in the lane ahead if KFC. Its a small and cute place to sit and relax with friends and put on calories �? Loved the food! Onion rings and cheese wedges! Both were great. Later ordered burgers The jalapeño burger was delicious�?�♥�? Will love to visit the place again to try the other different varieties. The quantity is filling. Staff is friendly and helpful. Music is good too. Not to loud. But enjoyable|positive
Rated A quaint little café, the ambience of this place has a capability of transporting you to a different time and a different city. The look of the place gave a cozy and amazing feel to it. Coming to the food, we went to this outlet during their 3rd birthday, thus everything was 50% off. However, even at 50% off, some of the food items were a tad bit expensive on the pocket. Their sandwiches and burgers come in a huge range and are creative as well as exotic at the same time. We tried their Jalapeno Popper Burger; full of mayonnaise, this treat has poppers sandwiched between breads along with all sorts of veggies making it crunchy, spicy, tangy and sweet, all at the same time. The fries served alongside were pretty good too. Coming to the Paneer Melt Sandwich, it was an explosion of paneer filling along with chillies and onions and many more. It was something to drool over. One of the best part of their food was the way they served it. Those cute little baskets give a homely feel as also you can grab unlimited ketchup, mayonnaise, and mustard sauce which are out to try. Their Strawberry Cheesecake Milkshake was nice-ish but it could have been better and thicker. The Berry Cooler was definitely a high score. All-in-all, it’s an amazing place, and if you don’t mind spending a few bucks on food, it’s definitely worth a visit. Ambience: 4.5/5 Taste Quotient: 4/5 Service: 3.5/5|positive
Rated Small outlet in Bandra. Good for burgers and sandwiches. If you are going on a weekend be ready to be waiting outside. The overall food is good and great place for eating something light|positive
Rated After postponing the visit to this place for days and days i finally got company to go here. If you know the area of bandra it won't be hard to find. It's a small place opposite to Hawaiian Shack. There were hardly 12 covers in the restaurant but we were lucky to find seats. The menu is good as it has a lot of options from sandwiches to burgers. And a variety for the sides to. The food was yum. And the staff was very friendly and polite. Highly recommended and will definitely go again|positive
Rated Bladder burst!!! The most happening event at chili's and I feel lucky enough to experience it on a Friday evening.. Perfect ambiance that sets up ur mood.. Friendly staff. Little heavy on ur pockets though. But good place to hang out with your friends..|positive
Rated We ordered ultimate dripper one evening with some mango iced tea. We were two people and this was really filling and delicious!! We skipped our dinner that day. Considering the brand name of the eatery , qty and quality of the food we ordered and the innovation done on food, price is ok. Not happy with iced tea though, too diluted with water..wasn't justifying the price.|positive
Rated The famous fast food joint opened in Inorbit about 2 years ago. Being a vegetarian I chose to stay away looking at their meat grilling specialities, till recently. A friend took me there for her birthday and since I enjoy Mexican food, I gave it a try. We went on a weekday and ordered from their specials. I had the chipotle pasta with vegetables and she, the grilled chicken meal with rice and beans. We also asked for the loaded fries with chili and cheese. The portions are huge. We could barely finish off our individual meals let alone the fries and these weekday meals come recommended for one. The pasta tasted good. A little bland and too creamy for me but not bad at all. I enjoyed the fries but the chili topping didn't pack any punch. My friend really liked her chicken dish and said it was grilled to perfection. The service is very warm and courteous. The server offers suggestions and asks you often how you like your food. Only thing is sometimes they go AWOL and are tough to catch attention of. Perhaps it was cause our server was handling 3 tables but it's not a deal breaker. The ambience is good enough. Over looks the mall and has a very southern American feel to it. I feel they can add more vegetarian options and customise the food to Indian palates a little. We have a dearth of Mexican restaurants here and Chilis is a novelty. And make it more pocket friendly please. It left us close to 2000 short just on 3 items.|positive
Rated You just can't drop in here casually as it's not that suitable for your regular pocket. pasta costs 500 including taxes and they said it serves only one person n asked her to upgrade it to large one by paying 150 more but we din go for that as we wanted to try first before getting too much and not liking it.|positive
Rated Only recommended for those who have a great taste for Mexican food. Ambiance is chilled out! What we tried is the double triple (didn't liked), Taco's (best best), some mocktail (you will love the way it is served ), burger ( was better), Chicken crisper (I had it all by myself liked it ) And most important don't miss out the MOLTEN CHOCOLATE CAKE ever PS: high on pockets|positive
Rated Mexican food here is my favorite. Good for fine dine.. Lil heavy on pockets.. But worth on part of taste Waiting on weekends.. Again worth it|positive
Rated So, first time here . A must try is the bacon ranch chicken quesadilla ! Fajitas were quite okay . I tried the chicken burger & it was quite dry ! The tacos were delish . The menu is way too elaborate . Good place for cocktails To top it off we had the chocolate chip paradise dessert . So fkin Rich ! All in all pretty decent place ! Will surely visit again .|positive
Rated When i stepped into this restaurant I was expecting some nice and authentic Tex mex cuisine . The first dish that we ordered nachos large was a complete disappointment. We got a long tray with 6 nachos topped with chicken pieces , salsa and cheese....a huge,huge disappoint as I was expecting a bowl filled with nachos topped with the guacamole n salsa exactly the way they serve it back in Fort Worth ,Texas . The bloody mary that I had ordered was okay. Next up was the chicken fajitas and I must say..they were exactly the way they should have been. Nice grilled chicken, warm fajitas, salsa, cheese, guacamole and cream....that was absolutely yummy. I would return to this place only for the chicken fajitas. The ambiance is nice . There is a well stocked bar where you can get Mexican beer like corona which has a slight lemony flavour and goes good with the Mexican food. As usual the waiters are prompt and on their toes. Pice wise the place is on expensive side . Definitely visit again to try some other Mexican dishes.|positive
Rated We have always come here with high expectations and chilis has ensured that they are met. With courteous staff, they ensure that us group of friends have a good time..!!! Cheers to chilis|positive
Rated The food was reasonably priced and just passable. Chilly Coriander Noodles were nicely spicy but still very tasty. The best thing in my order . The rest was disappointing The Murg Bhuna was tasty but the chicken contained a lot of bone and worse there were small fragments throughout the sauce. It was pretty much impossible to eat. What flesh I could get off the chicken was tough and dry. A real shame as the sauce was very good. The Veg sweetcorn soup was like wallpaper paste and had zero flavour. Not really worth eating, tasteless gruel. Given how good the noodles and Bhuna sauce was I'm pretty sure that there is a good cook in here somewhere but they need to improve their ingredients and presentation. I'll probably use them again but I'll be asking for the boneless dishes.|positive
Rated This place came as a surprise for me. Very good food and decent ambience with quick service. They have lot of options in food, we tried a lot of things. My favourite and star of d lunch were Paneer Cheese Tikka and Palak Cheese balls👌.. Even neer dosa were very good. Don't miss the Gadbad ice-cream, fantastic is taste n presentation. Must visit this place, if u around...|positive
Rated Let me start with if you wanna enjoy IPL screening on a rooftop or want to enjoy some great Indian delicacy (food) with great hospitality, do visit gurukripa. Gurukripa is a restaurant which is located in vicinity where I work and is quite popular out there. It is located near Chandivali petrol pump, close by are all the cooperate hubs. Have seen this restaurants thousand of times while travelling to office,heard good reviews from fellow colleagues and finally visited the place on my 8th invitation to a restaurant. Gurukripa operated since 1977, recently celebrated their 39th anniversary. A great achievement in a tough industry.The first sight from outside is the large hoarding displaying the name "Gurukripa" and posters of different cricketers catching on the IPL season. As soon as you enter the place, you will realize how well it is designed. The restaurant is divided into three sections. 1st a capacious air conditioned dining area. 2nd a small cosy open area adjoining the dining area and 3rd the rooftop where you can enjoy IPL screening on a large projector. It was lunch time and place was almost full to the large capacity. Beverages :- 1. Shirley temple..... a season special. It was a milkshake of King of fruits (mango) and nuts. This milkshake beats out the heat of summer. Very refreshing. I thoroughly enjoyed it. A must try. 2. Peru pyala :- A luscious mocktail fuse with guava ice cream,orange and pineapple juice. 3. Fresh lime soda :- It was okish. Fresh lime and sugar portion where prefect but was missing crushed ice (suggestion is to add crushed ice to it). Starters :- 1. Chicken ghee roast..... A Mangalorean delicacy had chunks of chicken.Chicken Ghee Roast was Fiery red, tangy and spicy with an unmistakable flavor of ghee roasted spices, this authentic chicken dish is not for the faint heart. Yummyinmytummy :) 2. Grill Basa black :- Basa is one of the most famous sea food appetizers now a days. Usually I don't prefer too much of pepper in any of my meal but this was one which I can eat without any hesitation. Grilled basa prepared in black pepper was nicely done. It was soaked into black pepper,red chillies and had tender meat. 3. Palak cheese balls :- Add cheese to anything and it just becomes hard to resist thing. These bite sized cheese balls very so appealing and had us drooling. Awesome, a must have. 4. Chicken Banjara kabab :- This was my favorite starter. Chicken Banjara was delectable spicy kebab fully loaded with the fresh spices, cilantro, mint and cumin flavor. Boneless chicken coated in the spicy marination of yogurt and then grilled in the oven was a real treat. 5. Grill chicken black pepper dry:- I did not find this one that good, may be because of pepper (i don't prefer it). I can say if you don't like pepper, miss this one. Mains:- 1. Neer Dosa with prawns curry..... was one of the best main course I had till date. Neer dosa was so soft and excellently cooked. Super delicious it was. Will like to try it again. If mangalorean neer dosa is your thing, you can't miss gurukripa. Prawns curry complimented neer dosa completely. This is what you call a complete meal. A alluring combo, go for it. Desserts :- 1. Gadbad (Icecream) :- Signature mangalorean icecream. A tall glass with layers of ice-cream, jelly, dry-fruits and fresh fruits. Presentation of ice cream was superb and then when you taste it, you are altogether in a different world. Again this one is recommended. 2. Hello To The Queen :- A remarkable,fascinating,enchanting dessert. A chocolate walnut brownie topped with chocolate,fruits,wafer biscuits,cheery and vanilla ice cream was toothsome. Do not misjudge the place by the name being a Punjabi or north Indian restaurant. This place mainly serves some extra ordinary south indian dishes. Also, don't underestimate the place with it's name, it is a power house (going strong since 1977). 1. Food 5/5 superb. 2. Ambience 5/5 has everything for every one be it family,cooperate or sports lover crowd. 3. Value for money 4.5/5 Food quality,quantity compliments the pricing. 4. Staff service 5/5 The hospitality is great. Very attentive and courteous. 5. Location 4.5/5 It is not "exactly exactly" in powai. It is near chandivali studio,chandivali petrol pump.|positive
Rated Visited this place recently for lunch with a friend. It was 1ish when we reached the restaurant and the place was full already. My expectations had increased by then. The restaurant is quite big and designed beautifully. They have a rooftop section as well which begins after it gets a little dark. There are personal sections as well incase you want to visit with your family and have a personal and a good time. So i would say this place has been designed and managed very smartly. Coming to the food: Mocktails Peru pyaala- very desi peru juice it was. It had dryfruits in it, and it had a very unique taste. loved it and definately a must try!! Fruit punch- its anyways an ever green mocktails for me. It was nice chilled and refreshing, perfect for a summer afternoon. Starters Harabhara kebab- This dish for me was good but definately not excellent. I was expecting the kebabs to be a little more cooked and crispier. But it was definately not bad at taste. Paneer cheesy tikki- This dish was my fav of all the others. Soft panner was stuffed with cheesy sauce which was excellent and then dipped in a batter and fried. Nice orange coloured starter it was. Tasted excellent, the softness of panner just took me to another world. Crispy potato- nice frechfries sort of potatos tossed in a chilly gravy. It was very good at taste but again this could have been a litlle more crispier. Roomali papad- it was a huge crispy roomali roti topped with onion, tomato, lemon, coriender and sev. It tasted good. The crispy roomali papad gave it a different and a good taste. Main course Korri rutti- This is a manglorian authentic dish that we tried that day on the managers recomendation and i cant thank him enough for introducing me to this excellent dish. It was nice chicken made in coconut gravy. The gravy was medium spicy an the chicken was very soft. This gravy and chicken is then poured on rice made crispy sheets. This combination is something to die for!! This dish is highly recomended!! Malai kofta-tried malai kofta as well. The gravy was nice and thick. The consistency of the dish was perfect. It was a nice rich cashew gravy. This dish is sweet incase some 1 doesnt know about it. The kofta was nice and soft. It was stuffed with some dry fruits as well. Loved it. Surely ordering this on my next visit. Paneer musalam- again this dish was recomended to us by the manager and we went on with his recomendation. It proved to be excellent 1 for us. Loved this dish to the core. Soft paneer done in nice medium spicy red gravy. Just loved it. Must try!! Stuffed kulcha- Very tasty and heavy. It tasted good with paneer musalam and malai kofta. Can definately opt for this aswell. Incase you have already had alot of starters go for plain naan or laccha paratha. Dessert Gadbad- Yet another speciality from manglore. This dish is basically ice cream topped with dry fruits and fresh fruits. And 3 such layers. It wa sa nice try. Can try this as well, as it had that nice indian dessert flavour!! Overall i had a great time here. Maincourse was bangon. Mocktails were excellent. And starter were good too. Service and ambience is also very nice. A surely must visit place if you are in or around powai and looking for a restaurant that has authentic Indian food. Cheers!!|positive

Rated "What really matters is invisible to the eyes" - said a wise human being once and this saying strongly holds true for this restaurant. As the name Gurukripa gleaming in white around green neon lights stared at us outside the restaurant, little did we know about the gastronomical extravaganza and culinary excellence that's in store for us within. Though the name seems to give out a very dull expression of the place, the food and hospitality of the place speaks otherwise, making this place a MUST visit! AMBIANCE: 4/5 The restaurant is divided into a spacious air conditioned interior dining section with comfortable seating arrangements perfect for a business meet or for spending quality time with family and a rooftop dining area again housing a bar smaller as compared to the one in the a/c section tucked away in a corner and a large OHP screen projecting music videos of the English classics and certain Bollywood songs being played out loudon the music system in the other end. BEVERAGES: 3.5/5 Peru pyala - A yummilicious mocktail comprising of guava ice cream that also imparted the required thickness to the mocktail apart from the flavour, along with pineapple juice and orange juice. Superb! Blue on the sky - This one was a vodka based cocktail made by adding blue curacao to vodka. Nicely done, but a little bit more sweet than my taste preferences. Orange Poma - A bittersweet concoction containing vodka, lime and orange flavour. Well done and so very refreshing! Mojito - My favourite amongst the cocktails I tasted that evening. This one was a perfect blend of mint leaves and lime, a concoction so soothing that it absolutely refreshed my soul! STARTERS: 4.5/5 Crispy Masala Roomali - A huge crispy roti topped generously with finely diced tomatoes, onions, sev, fresh chopped coriander and a hint of ghee. Yummmm! I can endlessly munch on this one and never get enough of it! Chicken Ghee Roast - Boneless bite-sized pieces of moderately spicy and delicious pan roasted chicken in ghee were served to us along with fresh salad. Brilliantly done! Grilled Basa Black Pepper - Basa fish meat seasoned with plenty of black pepper were then perfectly pan grilled giving thema slightly crispy exterior with aptly cooked tender and delicious meat within along with some veggies like spring onion greens and bulbs, split red chillies,cabbage, bell peppers, etc tossed in a wok. This was again garnished with a salad on the side. Crunchy Mushrooms- I couldn't taste this one since I'm allergic to mushrooms; but my pals who did, totally loved it! Batter fried mushroom moulds with a slightly crispy exterior were filled with a mixture of chopped mushrooms and plenty of cheese. The food art done with the help of green and redtomatoestotally beautified the dish! Chicken Jungli Kebab- This one was a variant of the good old Chicken reshmi kebabs where moderately spiced and marinated chicken in a green pastewere coated with egg whites before cooking them inthetandoor. I could appreciate the smoky flavour imparted by the tandoor but this one still has plenty of scope for improvement. MAINS: 4.5/5 Chicken Rara - An absolutely masaledaar, spicy, creamy and so yummilicious dish cooked to perfection with tender, well cooked and delicious boneless chicken meat. WOW! Prawns Pulimunchi - This classic Manglorean favourite - the Pulimunchi curry was simply nailed to perfection with wonderfully cooked spicy prawns in a hot, spicy and tangy curry. WOW again! BREADS: 3.5/5 To go with the mains were ordered a Roomali Roti,Butter Tandoori Roti and aGarlic Naan. They tasted good; not too doughy though the roomali roti was a tad bit dry. Overall, they didn't disappoint but still had scope for improvement. DESSERTS: 4.5/5 Gadbad Ice Cream - This was the restaurant's highly recommended signature dessert. A tall glass filled to the brim with a variety of Ice cream flavours like mango, etc, strawberry syrup, along with dry fruits like pistachios, cashews and raisins, sliced and diced fruits like banana, apple, green grapes and garnished with a cherry on top and wafer biscuits placed on two sides. Yummmm! Hello to the Queen - Yet another excellent dessert consisting of chocolate walnut brownie bits, topped with vanilla and chocolate ice creams, chocolate sauce, dry fruits like cashews and raisins, sliced bananas and a cherry on top along with chocolate sticks placed on the sides. SERVICE: 4.5/5 The service is very heart warming, welcoming, cheerful, attentive and warm. The service is unbelievably swift even while operating at full capacity that too on a weekday evening when we went here. VERDICT: Beverages - 3.5/5 Food quality - 4.5/5 Food quantity - 4.5/5 Ambiance - 4/5 Service - 4.5/5 VFM - 4.5/5 snehanvg.wordpress.com|positive
Rated Gurukripa - located in Powai - was a pleasant surprise. They say don't judge a book by it's cover and it truly applied to this restaurant. The place is actually fine dining with seating options available for both indoors and outdoors. The indoor seating has a fine dining formal ambience with good air conditioning and interiors. We preferred a more relaxed option upstairs which was outdoors. Even through it is located on the busy Saki Vihar road, the music ensured you don't hear d traffic. The ambience was perfect - cool breeze, big projector screen with songs and amazing music. We started with their special mocktail- Peru Pyala - which was a delicious mix of Guava, pineapple and orange juice. It was sweet but not too much and very refreshing. We went on a Wednesday and it was ladies night special offer of buy 2 get 1 free on their cocktails. I didn't drink but my friends enjoyed the Mojito, vodka based Orange Poma and Blue in the sky. Although the flavor was too strong for their taste. Before we started with the appetizers, we ordered for crispy masala roomali which was a HUGE masala papad. The masala was finger licking good and perfect to start with. In appetizers there's a wide variety available and we opted for non vegetarian dishes. We started with chicken ghee roast which had chunks of chicken well garnished and very tender to taste. It came with a side salad and we totally relished it. The next was grilled basa black pepper which was as the name suggests - basa fish prepared grilled style and in black pepper sauce. The fish was very soft and melted in my mouth. Amazing. Very much recommended. We also tried crunchy mushrooms - a crispy preparation stuffed with mushrooms and cheese with tid bits of capsicum too which really added to the taste. Again, a very good preparation. And this wasn't the end - we also tried their junglii kabab which was very creative - reshmi kebab wrapped around egg white. If you are used to the traditional way of Kebabs then you might not enjoy this. We finally moved on to the main course and started with their highly recommend and house special Chicken Rara. Loved the chicken gravy and the chunks of tender chicken. It was not too spicy and yet full of masala. The prawns pulimunchi were delightful but I'm not a big prawn lover. Believe it or not we still had room for dessert, a very little room though - we were served 2 of their house special Desserts: Gadbad Icecream which was a perfect blend of multi flavors icecreams with lots and lots of dry fruits and cherry on top. Another was very interesting name: Hello to the Queen which was chocolate walnut icecream with lot of chocochips. A perfect ending to a perfect evening. The hospitality was great too as the manager and the staff were very courteous and helpful in recommending dishes. Overall it was a great experience and a definitely a must visit place. Thank you Sneha Gopalakrishnan | Epicureans and Beryl Menezes | Epicureans for the awesome company. You guys made it perfect :-) divyatikiya.wordpress.com|positive
Rated Everything I was expecting from this place before visiting was fulfilled. Good service, awesome taste and a nice place to have a office lunch/dinner or with 3/4 friends. Good variety of starters both veg and non veg. Tuesday offers are also tempting. Will be visiting again soon.|positive
Rated It's a nice fine dining place which can be visited with family and friends. The ambience is soothing and seating is ample and comfortable. They have an extensive menu for both vegetarians and non vegetarians. The service is pretty nice and the food tastes good. The prices are little more than shown in zomato menu. It gives a nice overall experience and will not hesitate visiting this place again.|positive
Rated I ordered it for the first time and I wasn't pretty sure how it would be, but to my surprise the service was really pretty fast and the food wasn't that bad! A thumbs up to them|positive
Rated Good food. Amazing Biryani, specially know for non veg but even the veg biryani was amazing. Good taste and good service, and value for money. Quantity of food matches the price.|positive
Rated My only visit to this famed establishment came about when I was wandering around Byculla looking for a late night bite, and bumped into Persian Darbar. Was suggested the Mutton Kepsa Biryani by the waiter, and the dish turned out to be worth the wait. Elegantly garnished and majestic in quantity, it was a refreshing change, and a delicious one too, from the conventional Biryanis that I kept ordering for lunch at my workplace. Service was a little slow at the time, which did irritate us a little, but I'll form an opinion on their punctuality once I visit the restaurant in the normal hours. Great dining experience overall, and a must-try in town for biryani/mughlai. Food: 4/5 Hygiene: 4/5 Ambience: 3.5/5 Service (in my only visit): 3/5|positive
Rated Okay so here's a heads up cuz you're gonna need it if you haven't been here before. When you walk in, the ground floor seating isn't that grand. Quite shady actually. So go to the upper level which is much better. I'm guessing there are 3 levels. Tbh I wasn't at all wowed by the food. It was served to us cold and that was a big letdown considering that I had big expectations for this place.|positive
Rated Visited this famed mughal cuisine outlet well after midnight, surprisingly was teeming with patrons on all of its levels.. The service is good and the ambience quirky according to the restaurants various levels on offer... The biryani was good for a famed place like this but not upto the mark in terms of desired spiciness or the taste of those masalas that integrates itself with the chicken/mutton and the biryani rice.. To be frank, a little on the bland side. Various versions of biryani and mughlai cuisine available at a reasonable rate. Best for families or large groups to visit as the seating arrangements for such patrons are perfect.|positive
Rated A Non-veg buff and never been here? A big mistake! The place that defines great mughlai cooking. We started with mutton seekh kabab and chicken boti kabab which were juicy and just rightly spicy. We then ordered mussalam deluxe in red gravy and what a dish! So amazing in the gravy part and rumali roti made it all the way better. Not haevy on pockets and service is quick. Go for it!|positive
Rated When you reach here it looks like a small place but as soon as you enter you realise its pretty huge. The interiors look very authentic. You take any non-veg dish here and it will not disappoint you, specially, mutton raan and chicken biryani, they are amazing.|positive
Rated A Complete disastrous night.......went to have dinner at a place around lower parel but it had shut down early so searched for late night eatery around and found Persian darbar open till 3am. So we went ahead and thought of giving it a try as beggars can't be choosers n we had limited options available. As we entered it all seemed fine.....the interiors, the seating arrangement at different levels, the kind service, the private family cabins, and the choice of different cuisines like Chinese n moghlai. But when it came to food, we were highly disappointed. Being vegetarian we ordered Thai rolls and paneer crispy in starters. Paneer was chewy n not fresh at all and Thai rolls were simply pathetic. Main course was paneer tikka Masala and koftas with Indian breads......also dal tadka n jeera rice. Not a single dish could satiate our hunger.....none was worth any penny. The qty was poor too. Not great portions. The only 2 things we could enjoy were the roasted papads and phirnis. That's it. Had really high expectations from this place on seeing the rating of 4.1 but cld not bring myself to rate it more than 2. I am sure this place must be great for non veg but pls do work well on the veg section too.|positive
Rated One of the best in terms of mughlai food. Have been to this place many times before and the experience has always been good. On a lazy weekend ordered a take away from this famed outlet. The culinary experience included murg zafrani kabab,butter chicken and chicken tikka biryani. The zafrani kabab was excellent, succelent pieces of chicken wrapped in the aroma of saffron. The butter chicken had its signature taste and so did the biryani. The quantity was generous and the quality upto the mark. A must try place|positive
Rated Oriental is my game and there is no place in Bandra that does it any better than Mamagoto! It's reasonably priced for the food and alcohol and well with service on the slightly slower side. They keep re-inventing their menu with their dimsum and patty/bao menus. My favorite there is the chicken teriyaki bowl and the chicken udon! It's located centrally in Bandra so if you are in the vicinity do pop in or even if you make a trip especially for this place it will totally worth it! --A drop of ink may make a million think. @AyaashPaw pawanmanghnani.com|positive
Rated great place to hangout. quite a cool buzz about this bar. Great food, drinks, music tracks are well selected. will come again soon. good service.|positive
Rated Love the lotus stem its really exotic. Love phad Thai love this Restaurent it's good food n service. Love this kind of Thai. Nice for usual hang out.|positive
Rated The ambience is cozy and the staff very courteous. We ordered chicken sour and pepper soup which was awesome. For main course had Thai Red Chicken curry and veg fried sticky rice. It was yummmyy. Highly recommend the place.|positive
Rated Absolutely brilliant food... Will definitely visit again. Only had crispy lotus stem and pad Thai but really good and would Love to try the other dishes next time. Super fast service and a causal ambience!|positive
Rated Such amazing dishes! Contrary to my experience with Mamagoto at hyderabad, I loved what we had here. Udon, fried rice and lettuce wraps with whiskey sour. Thank you for a great time.|positive
Rated Long time coming this review. Visited this place almost 9 months back. We were there because they had some special buffet offer, and I have to admit this was one of the best meals I have had in a long time. Off the bat, would love to mention that I love the intimate and cozy interiors of this restaurant. Now the food.. Will start with the desserts because they were just splendid. They offered only 2 options - the Caramel Sponge Cake and the Coconut and Palm Sugar Icecream and both of them were just splendid. The latter specifically was brilliant, and if you are a fan of ice creams I suggest you give it a try. From the starters my favourites were the Chicken Basil Cups - nice bite sized morsels of tangy Chicken and the the Chicken Satay in Peanut Sauce - absolutely loved the Peanut Sauce, full on plate licking quality. They even offered stir fried Lamb, Chicken, prawns and veggies. The one main course dish I loved was the ever dependable Veg Thai Green Curry - really hearty, flavourful dish. For an extra 300 - 400 bucks they even offer unlimited sangrias which seems like a killer deal to me. They don't have this buffet all year round, I guess it's only twice a year for about two weeks, so better keep an eye out on their homepage. Because this is 1 meal I would definitely recommend.|positive
Rated Its Good. Located at Hill road in Bandra, this one is easier to locate Vs the Fort outlet Its a relatively small outlet. Decor is nice with smart usage of inexpensive yet elegant looking stuff. Staff is very courteous. Special mention for Joy who took good care. He changed the Red Shangria thrice, till i was alright with the taste, the moment he saw that i wasnt happy with it, immediately changed it. Basil cups are excellent, to be had almost like Paani puri. Veg clear soup was ok. The Soho Pan fried Noodle was suggested by them which was very Good. The Stir fried Udon noodles is one of their best Signature dishes. Thai basil fried rice was yummy The place gets packet after 8.30, go early to avoid rush during weekends|positive
Rated Sunday eve a new place to explore and have a relaxing dinner. If you are asian food lover than this is the place to be. The interiors and decor is bit dark but that creates the ambience! We dint reserve any place and just walked in. It was bit empty as we reached but slowly the place started full. We ordered street style spicy dumplings and teriyaki meal in a bowl with chicken. Both the dishes were nice but not that spicy as we had requested to make it spicy. But overall it was nice evening dinner. Service was also good.|positive
Rated If you really want some yummy Butter chicken with the Ambience that is "thoda Hatke" then this the place to be. Service can be a bit better .. but it's all Buffet and no Alacarte so go with the mindset to Hogg ..|positive
Rated I have been here with my college friends. The best thing to try here is pizza,panipuri and nacho. Just for this three thing we have been there for the second time. Most of the time its full so better reserve the table and go.|positive
Rated I was here for my club party. Picked this place for its themed ambiance of jungle and great spread and gladly this place did not disappoint in either of them. The place is so well worked upon that right from the entrance it feels like a club house in midst of amazon forests. The walls, tables, counters all are so perfectly blended into the theme that it gives an all round feel of dining in a jungle. Over that lighting is well managed and further enhances the beauty of decor here. Now coming to food, like every good buffet everything here is a star among the acceptable benchmark. Nothing is very particularly great to recommend but the spread as a whole is really good. Mainly having North Indian, Italian and Chinese cuisines, every item here can be enjoyed without any feel of disappointment. Whereas in other buffet places, starters are a highlight, here the mains are way better and well prepared to give you the satisfaction right till the end of the meal with a great spread of desserts. In all the place is highly recommended for it great decor and good food. My Rating: 1. Food: 3.5/5 2. Ambiance: 4.5/5 3. Service: 4/5 4. Value of Money: 3.75/5 neverknowsbest.in|positive
Rated When I first went to this place I had loved the theme , that's whast attractive about this place , the food is good , good variety as well , you get a mixture of food , deserts are nice .|positive
Rated Caught a mini school reunion of our gang on a lazy Sunday afternoon. Did prior reservations for our group as its a place quite famous for its buffet spread. We all reached the place at our appointed time. The best part of this restaurant is its jungle themed ambience. The second best would be the starters which are served on the table. So we had a good start eating spiced tandoori chicken, fish fries, chicken & lamb kebabs. They also have a live counter serving pani puri and nachos and pastas, as per ones tastes. As always we filled our stomachs with the starters. On the main course the noodles, fish in oyster sauce were quite flat. They did serve tandoori rotis on our askance on the table. The steamed rice & paneer butter masala was good in vegetarian fare. The desserts my favourite lacked variety. Besides hot gulab jamun and fruit custard, other pastries were not so good.Ice creams were also available. While the ambience & starters score, the service is quite drab,for buffet standards. They can really do a lot better on that area. For many a times our table was short of water, even after asking for the same to our attendee. The starters were coming so late on to our table or sometimes it was heaped in each plate. In the end nobody came forward to proactively clean our table, even when we stood up to take desserts. Ultimately we ourselves had to pick it and keep it aside. Overall I would still recommend all to visit for its comfortable ambience & starters, but service really needs a drastic improvement.|positive
Rated The jungle themed buffet restaurant is something out of the ordinary and created wildlife dining ambiance.Its a buffet place and has tasty food, pani puri, nachos, garlic bread, pasta are served from live counters, the rest of the starters are served on your table. Main course was okayish but the Indian desserts were good.|positive
Rated The rating is for the ambience. Cost is good for the food served. The service is also good. But the restaurant has to come up with better mock tails. Although the name is quite funky, the taste was pretty bad. The only drink worth having is the Virgin mohito. The place definitely has scope of improvement. But definitely a one time visit.|positive
Rated A place I would love to visit again and again. Prompt service and definitely a lot much organised. Can't get better ! Keep up the service !|positive
Rated ambience is too good... paneer sizzler is yummy... quantity is enough for two... spacious... service is fast.... menu is short but to the point.... had an awesome birthday date here...|positive
Rated Great place. Had planned for a multi cuisine dinner after a long drive and that went well when dinner was at Food Studio . Ordered a mix of meals like dumplings, pizza, lasagne,fried rice & sizzling brownie . All of them was good . Staff is very courteous and ambience is also good . Price, quality & quantity all 3 is good. Would surely visit this place again.|positive
Rated One of the best restaurants in navi mumbai. I didnt expect much but was shazamed when the food arrived. V ordered fr americani fries n man were they loaded with cheese n its was sharp tasty cheese with corn n capcicum tiny dices. The lamb honet chilli , u just cant stop . N then the standing pomfret wa really nice n yes the kheema pizza. I have nobwords. Absolute value fr money.|positive
Rated Now this place is loaded with lots to provide to its hungry customer. Good ambiance, quite attentive and followup staff to look after the customer especially when they have started with their meal and if they require any other additions. Seating at certain place were little uncomfortable and upon request of a specific seating which were for more than 4 customer were promptly provided without much hassle. Chicken Dumplings were very good to start with and then ended up with Grilled Chicken Sizzler which was awesome but somehow felt that the chicken could have been grilled more and served with more heat. overall, the experience were more satisfying than how its written.|positive
Rated Its a super awesome place i loved this place very much food is damn tasty and not that expensive Must try chicken nawabi starter its just awesome �?|positive
Rated Lovely place situated on the main road near Satra Plaza. The place looks really elegant from the outside and you will be instantly attracted to go in. Even on the inside, the interiors are very well done! Food and drinks are priced reasonably. The food tastes good and the service is quick too! Overall a good experience!|positive
Rated Good place to eat in new Bombay. It was a good experience there. Kid friendly. Starters were good. Bartender was able to make some nice drinks. The cosmopolitan was a nice drink the ladies enjoyed.|positive
Rated Had lunch yesterday here.. food- GOOD! We had saiwoo chicken its a lil sweet n spicy with spinach loved it... chilly prawns n fish fingers were nice. For mains mutton boti was delicious and white sauce pasta ,cilantro chicken too. Ambience- good. Ull like the infrastructure. A total family place. And very reasonable on pocket. The mud pie was too yumicilious dont miss that..|positive
Rated The food studio is a combo of a restaurant and a cafe! And has a very nice interior. I loved the huge frame of the palm beach road! Coming to the food, it was quite decent but nothing very unusual. We ordered chicken saiwoo but I found it very sweet but the spinach with it was amazing! Also, a bit disappointed with chicken. It was very hard to bite. Service was slow as it was crowded. It was my friend's birthday so they gave a complimentary drink! It was a good time overall!|positive
Rated Good service. Glass were refilled on time. Enjoyed IndvsPak match here. Was a loud crowd due to the match. Management was fine with it. Ordered: Paneer in garlic sauce Cheese balls (yummy!) Five spice veg with fried rice Ambiance: 3/5 Food: 3.5/5 Service: 4/5|positive
Rated I was here last Saturday with my bestie... Heard quite a lot about this place so tried it out. Very mediocre... I must say. Not bad, but definitely not high up on the mark. The food was also very ok ok.. We went for the fondue and cottage cheese quesadilla. The fondue could have been better, it was simply white sauce with lumps of refined flour... It could have definitely been made better. The quesadilla how ever was good. What really struck out during the meal was the mint & cucumber mojito... Amazingly made... Right to my palate! The associates here are definitely extremely helpful and courteous.|positive
Rated Noisy place to be in. Ambience is nice. Service is bang on. Waiters are polite in handling orders. Food is Authentic nd good but we were unlucky in ordering it.. We had ordrd Cheese Fondue which was blaand for us..|positive
Rated A friend's b'day party bought us to this place and the whole experience was great. Starting with the ambience the place is not that big as I expected so one can't experiment with ambience a lot so it was a sort of ambience you expect in a fine dining restaurant. The food is what makes this place worth it, we ordered a range of dishes and all tasted great and presented beautifully. The desserts need a special mention because they're all great and must have. Overall this place is Worth a shot!|positive
Rated Quattro Ristorante serves authentic Italian cuisine par excellence.. Located bang Opp Paladium Lower Parel.. It's in heart of Sobo's action...

Rated Me and my food freak friends dropped at this place at around 10:15 PM in the middle of Navratras to honor the bit of religion that we followed. Proudly had i told my parents (who were elated about my vow of vegan-ism for those 9 days) that I had found a vegetarian place rated 4.2 above on zomato with an astonishing number of votes. But alas! Quattro was a bit of disappointment for me. FOOD : 3/5 We ordered the southwestern rolls, Risotto Pale, Mediterranean pizza, Ravioli Rose, enchiladas Grande and chocolate dunkers along with their virgin mojito and kiwi margharita. We were told that the south western rolls were no longer available which was a huge disappointment given that it is their signature dish ( This happened again with my friend when she visited at 7:30 PM on a saturday). The risotto pale was unique but not mindblowing and the pizza was average, nothing special. The ravioli was too sweet but tasted nice and was well cooked and stuffed. The enchiladas were great, definitely worth a shot. The chocolate dunkers were decent too, mostly because of their presentation. Another big disappointment was that most of their dishes were not available. We were asked to choose among 3 desserts inspite of seeing about 10 on the menu. The drinks were good enough. The presentation was creative on most dishes especially the chocolate dunkers (pictures attached). AMBIENCE: 3.5/5 The place is clean and simple and has a lively feel to it. SERVICE: 4/5 The service was also decent apart from the in-availability of a lot of dishes we were mostly satisfied with the service. MUST HAVE: Nothing really ! (maybe because I still haven't been able to taste the south-western rolls and a lot of other things. Will probably give the place another shot given its rating and try a lot more dishes)|positive
Rated Located opposite the much acclaimed Phoenix Mills in lower Parel. Quattro ristorante is one the best in that area when it comes to Decent sit down and eat food. Especially if you are visiting it with a group of friends. Quattro ristorante, one of the four hotels grouped under Lemon Chilli, is the truely fantastic. Food: So it started with "Nachos Grande" we ordered two portions, since we were 9 people and boy it was fantastic, it was indeed grande, however I might add, it was not one of most awesome nachos I've had in Mumbai, but it ranks amongst the top 5, too cheesy, and liquidy made some of its crispness lost. However, the portion was justifying for the cost. Than came the "Bruschetta", perfect simply perfect, flavour was there, and so was the taste, topped wid 2 slices of cottage cheese, wid cherry tomatoes, and some green foam (whose taste was hardly felt, maybe attraction value), was amazing. Over the main course.. We decided to have BBQ cottage cheese pizza, straight out of the wooden oven, another classic act, perfectly cooked, crispy and of course tasty. However, since I'm quite accustomed to the usual trend of the pizza sauce being sour and spicy, the pizza sauce at this place took me by surprise, when it turned out to be a little sweet, whilst I didn't find it spicy, but then what are chilly flakes for ! One of friends came up wid one of the must have dishes through the Internet, and so we ordered that, the dish was " Risotto Palle", classic cheesy Risotto balls fried and served with injectable Chilli oil, certainly a run for the money, tasty and flavour full plus the added showcase-ness make you feel happy. We had a no. Of Virgin Drinks at this place, "Mango Basil Smoothie", " Mint Cucumber Mojito", "Ginger watermelon Mojito", "Kiwi Cola", whilst all were great, the Kiwi COLA stood above being the best of all. Surely a to be tried thing. I would also say, they served some of the awesome chutney platters I've had in Mumbai, there were 8 sorts. I won't describe them, I would ask you to go there and taste them. Something definitely to look forward to. Ambiance: The ambiance as is the food Top-class ! The service is smooth, the staff is really good too, they themselves know what they are serving, unlike many fine dines where the staff is usually clueless. I did require assistance on the chutney platter I mentioned above, and the guy on staff gleefully helped.|positive
Rated I had actually just heard about and finally I went here yesterday for dinner with my friends. I loved the food and the ambiance. The service was very good here. The staff was very friendly. It's more famous for Mexican food. It's a very good place to visit and some good vegetarian food here. It has good variety of Mexican , Italian food. I love the nachos and pizza here. And my friend thanked me for getting him here. I had just heard of my friends saying that here the food is good so the food is good. I would definitely recommend ppl to visit this place|positive
Rated We had been to Quattro Ristorante quite recently and have been glad to discover the makeovers of traditional Italian and Mexican cuisines there. The service here is impeccable and the waiters suggest how much would be adequate and do not just fool you into buying more than you need. The ambience is dim and calm and gives a warm feeling. Coming to the food, it is one of the best vegetarian Italian cuisine you can have in Mumbai. The only drawback I find is, it does not serve non veg. For soups, we tried The tomato with roasted corn and ravioli - it was a nice twist to the age old tomato soup wherein the deep fried croutons were replaced with a healthier spinach and ricotta ravioli. It was accompanied by an olive bread and a miniature multigrain bread and a dollop of butter Aerated Mushroom and leeks - the soup was thick and reach and lukewarm. It was the exact temperature to be hot enough to enjoy without burning the tongue. As for the taste, it was pretty much like any cream of mushroom soup you would have in a restaurant. For appetizers, we had Garlic Bread - warm and cheesy but pretty much the way you find it in all restaurants Smoked Cottage Cheese in a jar - these were cottage cheese balls in a glass jar filled with barbecue smoke! The crunchy texture and the rich smokey flavor took us on a treat literally. Risotto Palle - it is one of their signature starters where a crunchy ball of cheesy Rice is served alongside a delicate complementary dip and injected with chilli oil pippete style droppers. Filo Parcels - The presentation of the dish is very tempting with the parcels arranged around a flame in the centre of the plate and the taste is good but nowhere close to the other two starters. All things considers, it fared pretty average. Our main course included Alfredo pizza - it was a white pizza and was a welcome variation from the tomato Basil based pizza. The crunchy texture of the thin crust coupled with a generous load of cheese and sweet corn left is wanting more. Risotto Funghi - the flavors are very delicate and the rice, unlike the risottos at most restaurants, is not at all mushy or pasty. Drizzle some of the olive oil from the table and there would be nothing like it! The best part, the desserts included :- Dehydrated Chocolate Mousse - it had Mint ice cream accompanied by thin milky chocolate flakes. Chocolate Saturn and Hot Chocolate Soup - This dessert is a must have, especially for those who have a weakness for chocolate. The white chocolates filled with mango Jelly are a favorite with kids. Chocolate dunkers - it is served as an artists pallette! The vanilla ice cream was normal, the chocolate bars in Filo were pretty good. The strawberry Sauce was just average but the chocolate and caramel Sauces and mint caviar were the excellent accompaniments. Bianco Semifreddo - it is like an easter egg full of sugar, spice and everything nice. Its basically a white chocolate she'll with edible golden paint on the outside and filled with cranberry and white Chocolate mousse. A bit on the sweeter side than most desserts, it's definitely a desert that I would come back for. The complementary dark chocolate Truffles were the best thing to to the meal off. Ambience 3.5/5 Service 5/5 Food 4.5/5 Price 4/5|positive
Rated I love Quattro! They have the finest Italian food I've had in Bombay. The ambiance is perfect, the service is impeccable and the food is too good. We started with Filo pastry which was quite good. I then devoured a Penne Arrabbiata by myself. I love my Penne Arrabbiata and I want it to be perfectly tangy and Quattro's Penne Arrabbiata was everything I wanted. Before mentioning what we had for dessert, let me say that they have the best dessert menu in town. We ordered the chocolate Saturn which was to die for. As if that wasn't enough, I came here twice just for the dessert. Had the Pebbles and the Chocolate Explosion. The Chocolate Explosion is the finest thing I've seen ever. The way they present it to you on the table is worth every penny. Quattro is a gastronomical experience that everyone must experience.|positive
Rated This place is located exactly opp phoenix mall, u will get all veg restaurant here like spice klub, rolling pin, riso & this one quattro, but quattro is my one of d fav restaurant in this all, some dessert served here is so amazingly, taste of Italian cuisine was mouthwatering, service was also good, wonderful experience for me.|positive
Rated One of the best places to eat your pizza's and pasta's! Wonderful set of pizza's.. The grande nacho pizza being the tastiest of the veg collection and the classic jalapeño Mac n Cheese is ofcourse the tastiest thing I've ever had. Give it a try, it's an awesome place to enjoy a chill lunch/dinner with a bunch of friends. Also, the ambience, service and quality of food is fantastic.|positive
Rated I'm not a pizza fan. But this place pizza's are pretty good. Really innovative and must try pizza's. Few of my favorites are:- nachos pizza, fruits of the jungle pizza, peri peri paneer pizza�?� Would like to see more of the starters on the menu. Desserts are pretty average. But all together a cute nice place with good food. Francesco's Pizzeria #mustcomehereplace|positive
Rated A mediocre safe space where the taste is as subtle as its pricing.....it does give the restaurant quality food but nothing that you haven't had before..the anti-pasti was really delicious, which was pared with a decent pizza and equally lacking cheese cake...you don't exit this place with a smile but nor with a regret..|positive
Rated Lovely interiors. The seating was very very comfortable. The staff was SO cooperative and quick. My phone was running out of battery. They even got me a charger. The staff was really kind and quick but. So coming to the food part. Loved the food. Was a Saturday evening. So my friends and I thought it was okay to splurge on a fancy pizza place. It's worth it once in a blue moon. But totally worth it. Thin crust pizzas are scrumptious. So we ordered for a mushroom zucchini one. They were generous enough with the mushrooms. We ordered for a risotto. The quantity of the risotto was really good. Again this was with mushroom and cheese base. You must must must try the red velvet waffles here. They're simply bliss. They come with three toppings. Honey, chocolate and maple. They also give ice cream and whipped cream along with it. It'll leave you with a sedated feeling.|positive
Rated Situated at the High Street Phoenix, this is one outlet that’s hard to find. We felt like sweeping through a labyrinth of mazes after having finally located the outlet. This place was full when we arrived and were requested to wait for 20 mins., which was a sure sign of the pizzeria’s popularity amidst it’s competition. Décor: 4.0 I absolutely loved how the overall design played with an idea of combining the mill architecture achieved through the retention of exposed beams, stucco painted bricked walls and factory windows with hints of vintage that resonate through the use of oversized couches at the entrance, carved chairs in bright red colours & side stations that one would find at a typical victorian home. The décor receives a definite thumbs up. A word of advice though: - Please do avoid the oversized arm-chairs at the entrance as these were highly uncomfortable and I had to practically sit upright throughout my meal without a back support. How I wish that I asked one of the courteous servers to shift us over to one of the tables flanked by comfortable dining chairs. Food: 4.5 We placed an order for the following:- 1) Beverages: A) Banana Caramel Milkshake & B) Tiramisu Iced Tea Of the two beverages that we tried I’d highly recommend the Banana Caramel Milkshake for it’s wholesome goodness of cream, caramel and chunks of bananas 2) Antipasti: Garlic Ciabatta Mini Loaf with Cheese The slices of bread were fresh, smelled amazing with the generous smearing of garlic butter on top with the molten cheese. 3) Pizza: The Notorious Nachos Polls If one married a plate of Topped Nachos replete with Re-Fried Beans, Spicy Chicken & Salsa with the humble Pizza Margarita the outcome would be the “Notorious Nachos Polls�?. I loved the idea of having two of my favourite fast food dishes served on a single plate. So if you ever face a dilemma of choosing between Mexican & Italian you know where to head. ;) 4) Pasta: Fettuccine with Chicken & Porcini Mushrooms This pasta in particular is highly recommended. If one chooses to opt for a Pizza or Pasta I’d suggest that one opt for the above. The sauce was highly flavorsome with just the right consistency & creaminess. The pasta cooked to perfection and the chef was really generous with the mushrooms and chicken. 5) Desserts: Francesco’s Signature Broffle We finally arrive to the star of the meal. Their signature dessert needs no introduction. A combination between a Brownie and Waffle this dessert won our hearts over. Served with Choc. Sauce, Syrup and Ice-Cream the Broffle was sinfully indulgent, and highly recommended. Stay away if you’re a gym freak though. A single serving would have you running the treadmill for a couple of hrs. for sure. Service: 4.5 The servers are polite, highly attentive and do know their menu. A few queries here and there weren’t reciprocated with blank faces, which was a definite relief. V.F.M: 4.0 We opted for a prefixed menu through WOW Tables which did not include the 02 Beverages. The Starter, Pizza, Pasta and Dessert worked up to 1200/- All Incl. which albeit steep was worth, considering the presentation, portion sizes & flavour.|positive
Rated A really cute place adjacent Palladium mall. Rugged yet pretty white brick walls. Bright lights over every table. The concave mirror kind of thing on the walls. I just loved this one! The mix and match chairs. Interiors- Very nicely done! Mhmmm the food ! For starters, we had Panzerotti. Looked like a karanji. But inside the covering there was loads of cheesy bliss with seasoned mushrooms. The red sauce and the flavoured mayo which was served along with it totally enhanced its flavour. Also, the dish was well presented. #mustHave Coming to what they are famous for! Their pizzas. Peri peri paneer pizza - Thin and crispy crust. Loads of well marinated paneer. Lime flavoured mayo spread and loads of cheese. The flavoured mayo gave a really nice twist to the pizza. #mustHave Fetuccine and porcinni mushroom pasta - Pasta in creamy white sauce. I found it a little bland. That's how italian cuisine is suppose to be. But my friends loved it ! They do not serve veg lasagne. So we ordered the chicken lasagne and totally regretted the decision. Totally bland and extremely dry. No flavour at all. It had become a task for us to complete that dish. The best part of the entire meal - BROFFLE!!! #mustHave Waffles made pieces of browie in it. Accompanied with thick chocolate sauce, maple syrup and vanilla ice cream. Heaven!|positive
Rated This place looks beautiful with good ambiance. The food is tasty. Although, I didn't have much. Just a slice of pizza but that too was lovely. Pricing, yeah, a little heavy on pocket at times. Desserts, were good too. Service, really good. They can do better but i was not disappointed. Will I visit again? Definitely yes.|positive
Rated A small and cozy joint along the bylanes of phoenix mills and has a italian bistro feel to it. Ordered tomato basil soup, peri peri chicken pizza, chicken bbq pizza and a virgin mojito to wash it down. The tomato basil soup was refreshing, warm and unlike the tomato puree conconction expected. The peri peri chicken and bbq pizza were the show stealers. The dough was fresh and so were the ingredients. The pizzas were saucy with good toppings and very filling. A must visit.|positive
Rated As much as I don't want to be partial while writing this review, I have to be because of my everlasting and undying love for the crust and texture of Domino's Pizza. Francesco Pizza isn't bad, it does the job of filling up your pizza cravings. We ordered a large Pepperoni Pizza coz Pepperoni is Pepperoni. Although it looked delicious and it actually was to some extent, the amount of oil/butter that went on to make the pizza was way too much. I almost got full, with just a slice of Pizza. That never usually happens. I shall update this review once I get ahead on the menu.|positive
Rated Got new and fresh place to have pizza n pastas. Overall all best in taste, ambience is gr8 , service was good. Specially you will get whole wheat pizza. Diet lovers you can have now 😉. Had ordered chicken Africano peri peri and rays veg ultimate. Both pizza were awesome, had tried pasta also but it was ok may be I had in veg dats y �?. All pizza lovers should try once. Great place|positive
Rated Awesome! They write on their delivery boxes " slice from heaven" and I think it's 1000% true!! The Medium crust classic pizza melted in our mouths. It was piping hot when it reached us, & stayed that way for quite some time which is rare. The service is great, all waiters are smiling. It's just a small place so possible not to get space to sit on weekends. The sandwich was okay, I would suggest going for pizza & garlic bread here.|positive
Rated Very very cute though small place... It is amazing how they have managed to make almost a small Italian pizzeria look and feel in the heart of Mumbai. As soon as you enter you get the smell of fresh dough and amazing tomato sauce. We went ahead and ordered the Pizza with chicken marinated in Spicy Peri Peri sauce. The chicken pieces were perfect size and splattered all across the pizza at almost equal intervals. The 9" thin crust 100% whole wheat pizza was really nice, almost as good as those at Pizza Express, at 60-70% of the price. For me the kicker was the Hearty Vegan pizza. For the first time I decided to try a pizza without cheese (gasp!). While it originally came with it's toppings of spinach, basil, artichoke hearts and garlic, I requested for an addition of caramelised onions, which they were happy to accommodate. Surprise surprise! The pizza was absolutely yummmm! The base was nice and crisp and the mixing of the tomato sauce with the toppings was delectable! The 100% whole wheat crust did not make any difference and just gave the psychological edge of being healthier. The only hitch - for people with our appetite, a 9" thin crust might not suffice for a full meal. 2 pizzas + 1 additional topping cost us just Rs. 790 AI. (Absolute value for money!)|positive
Rated Not a restaurant that u will be able to spot so easily. On hill road just behind mamagoto. Small place with an AC and open section One of the best place for thin crust pizza. It literally melts in your mouth. Fire and smoke Mexican flame Creamy pesto Work sandwich Service is polite and well trained staff. Definitely recommend this place for a pizza. It's definitely worth it|positive
Rated Tucked behind mamagoto in bandra this place specializes in pizzas. Ingredients were absolutely fresh especially the sauce and the cheese the main 2 ingredients. We ordered jalapeno garlic bread,cheese garlic bread and bruschetta on the sides and they were perfect with lots of fresh garlic on top. Lasagne was very OK. Nothing much to write about.Pizzas are brilliant. If you're in the mood to indulge in pizzas this is the place to be. Ambience is very pleasing too with separate outdoor seating.|positive
Rated Located behind mamagoto in bandra.. It seems to be a hidden gem.. A cozy little place.. With decent ambience.. Pizzas are a must have here.. Pizzas are available in 3 different sizes.. 9inch 12inch 16inch.. And 4 different crust.. Pizzas were really nice.. Also sandwich options too are pretty nice..|positive
Rated Loved the quaint pretty place with subtle European decor. In terms of the epicurean feedback, not much to recall. The shakes and entree are pretty good however pizza lovers wouldn't find it meaty enough!|positive
Rated The simplest of the pizzas at @rayscafe1 that is margherita and basil pizza is so well made and so delicious! . . Ray's Pizzeria and Cafe is a quaint little place, set hidden in the streets of Hill Road, Mumbai. The decor is gorgeous, with little flowers welcoming you in the open seating area, and a small cottage for the air conditioned seating. The pizzas, are freshly made in front of you, in their English style open oven. Worth a visit definitely! For more updates , follow me at @eatbeforeyoueat on Instagram !|positive
Rated When I ask for a Mac n cheese idk why it was never mentioned that I'd be charged for the cheese. Like Seriously? Isn't cheese already supposed to be one of the main components of the dish. Other than that I've had impeccable food at HRC though expensive for me. I'd come here to enjoy a meal listening to Metallica and The Doors playing in the background. Cuz for me, music is above all and HRC is meant for music and it's rustic vibe.|positive
Rated So I was here for our Team appreciation lunch yesterday. Had heard a lot about the vibes of this place. We were a group of 8 that tried their buffet. The spread of the buffet was not extraordinary but it was quality nevertheless. The place has a very good and enjoyable ambience. Although, I am fully aware that this place is much better in the evenings than afternoon, it still was quite enjoyable in the afternoons. The buffet started with some tomato and basil soup and about 3 salads. There weren't any starters which raised a couple of eyebrows but the main course was good enough. All in all, a good place to visit. No complaints whatsoever .|positive
Rated Been my favourite since the beginning of the time. Real musical heritage. Yummiest burgers n all the types of food they serve are filling n yummy. Very peppy staff. Cool parties.|positive
Rated Its said Music has power as strong to put your mind at ease and the other day this place really made me feel it. Nothing extraordinary in terms of music, its plain rock music but its the space, decor and ambience which gives a very relaxed feel. Themed around rock music, its the place to be for rock music lovers. We were here with some office colleagues during happy hours and had multiple rounds of Cocktails and Mocktails. While all ordered was quite appreciated on the table, I quite enjoyed my Peach Iced Tea and Double Berry Cooler. Must say the service was great and the staff was very friendly and helpful. To munch we ordered for Non veg platter, Fries and Nachos Palooza Vegetarian. I would say I wasn't particularly impressed with the Nachos. Fries was quite nice. To our surprise we were served Brownie and Vanilla Ice Cream with compliments. And it was simply awesome. I will want to come back here to try some more things on the menu. But the experience with food, puts me in two minds.|positive
Rated This place is the haunt for all parties / celebrations as it's right next to office. People make the place while ambience adds to the flavor. The staff here seem to be highly motivated for they have a chilled out go for the grabs attitude. While drinks are the same everywhere, the food variety is awesome. The A-La- Carte menu is great and so is the set menu. A must visit place. A lower score is on account of managing service for a group >5-6 Cheers Amit|positive
Rated Our usual "Team Lunch" place. Well to start off, always liked the ambiance HRC offers. The guys are warm & friendly, but usually tend to forget orders or delay it. Puts off the mood at times. This time we had haystack salad, Mediterranean chicken spaghetti and a juicy chicken burger. Food is something i really like what they offer, but this time i was blown away. Tried the desserts- apple pie, brownie and a cake slice. Wonderful! Fresh, tasty and appetizing food. Recommended for ppl who have inclination towards good food with some good music in the background.|positive
Rated Great place to be on a Saturday night. Ask me, I've spent quite a few at Hard Rock. Happy place, happy people, happy staff, you just don't anything else. Wait, yes, the food, obviously! My pick of the lot would be Jumbo Combo Chicken which comes with an add-on for BACON (need I say more)!|positive
Rated I would have given 100 stars if possible!! Went for a IND vs PAK match today.(Yes, We were lucky enough to get advance reservations!!🤘) God!! This guys are crazy.. Totally loved it there✌✌ Awesome people.. Drinks.. Food.. Service.. PERFECT!! It was so crowded but they were managing everything so good.. And the best part DANCE!!!! (I won't forget victory celebration.. CRAZY!!) YMCA... I'm coming back soon😘😘😘 U GUYS R BEST!!|positive
Rated We went in here for Gourmet Day 2.0 courtesy WowTables for dinner. We had a set four course meal and we thankfully happened to get here just at the time of our reservation. The interiors and the ambiance of this place are great. They have a sprawling place right at Veera Desai Road and it's hard to miss. Although, I wish they'd do something to their doors - maybe add a door knob or two! Their interiors have a very rustic yet sophisticated charm that I really love. Their cutlery is great as well but it would be nice if we were given cloth napkins instead of paper towels. We called for the Garlic Bread with Cheese for starters. The bread was decent but just three pieces were too small a portion size. Also I felt there wasn't enough cheese for the bread. Our next course was an option between Pasta or Salad or rissotto. We option for the Rissotto with Mushroom and Chicken. The rissotto was made with very nice quality rice you could tell, coz each grain was so fluffy and wholesome. The sauce was pesto and we felt that it was a tad bit to dry, could do with a little more sauce. The rocket leaves added a great zing to the taste of the rissotto. This was followed by the pizza which we were warned at the time of ordering, that it wouldn't be one of their classic thin crusts but we decided to go with it anyway coz it was the only Chicken option. The pizza was great, the crust though not their typical thin ones was not doughy and tasted wonderful. For our last course we chose the Raspberry Sorbet which was oh-so-delicious. The sorbet was pretty as a painting and had a fresh, zesty, lemony taste. The service was efficient and our server was kind and helpful. Definitely coming back here! thefoodauror.blogspot.com|positive
Rated I have been a regular here and this literally is my favourite place for salads and pizza's. I feel like this place serves the best Pepperoni pizza in Bombay. Infact i went there just yesterday and tried their Sunrise Ice Tea (blend of orange juice, pineapple juice and ice tea) and fell in love with it. Absoultely refreshing !!! You should try this if you are a pizza lover !!|positive
Rated Love the Roman pizzas here. Light and the taste of every ingredient comes through. Starters are great. So are desserts and drinks. Love the sense of space. One of my favourites for a lazy weekend lunch.|positive
Rated Open space. Enthusiastic servers. And food that looks and tastes fresh. All of that with some great choices in the bar and u r all set for a repeat visit. Went here for post work drinks n munchies. Loved their salads - the warm veg and goats cheese salad was great as was the chicken salad polo. The chicken starter on skewers was served on a bed of olives and watermelon. Loved it ! And the pizza had the thinnest crust ever. Only grouse was that they were out of rocket leaves which was an essential component in all the things I wanted to order. However whatever was served was quite nice. And the chilled Bira beer was the perfect companion to all the great tasting grub. Cheers!|positive
Rated Since the day I have had my first bite of pizza at pizza express there is no turning back.it's the best place to have pizza, you will forget about all the stupid pizza outlets.I have tried Pollo forza, Polpette Bolognese which are my favourites.Even their fresh home drinks are a must try! I think whatever they serve is the best.|positive
Rated Place for a great pizza - yes How was the crust - thin but unlike papad Toppings - brilliant , juice meatballs Freshness of the toppings - the cheese just right quantity, the sauce was yum, onions crunchy Overall pizza - finished in 10 mins Happiness quotient - 10/10 hahahah|positive
Rated Dough balls. All the pizzas. Desserts. Drinks. I love this pizza place. If you're an architect and a foodie you'll definitely love this place.|positive
Rated Pizza express says it all its at the top of serving you fresh and hot wood fire oven's pizza's in town. We had ordered Hot american pepporoni pizza which was really good and we even ordered dough balls.. Well that is not that great suggest you to oder something else in terms of appetizers. But the pizza's do keep up to the expectation.. Great place.|positive
Rated Had hosted our post wedding party. We were really impressed by their spectacular service. We were given a good dining area away from the crowd. It was like a private party. They serve the yummiest food. The staff was helpful and friendly.|positive
Rated One stop destination to all problems. Has great food, spectacular service and in short, makes me very happy! The kababs are brilliant, so is the steamed fish in Singaporean sauce. I will not talk about price, yes slightly steep when it comes to seafood BUT its the price one pays for good food and service...every bit worth it �? I'm visiting them again, tonight. Their manager is very hospitable and always makes it a great dining experience. Friends or family, ideal place for any time of the day.|positive
Rated One of the many posh restaurants near Juhu Beach, this one lives up to its number of stars. The ambience is great, with soft music and dim lights and an amazing decor. Service was great! 5 stars for our waiter and maître'd. We opted for a majorly South Indian based cuisine with Rawas in a spicy mangalorean curry and a mildly spiced Chicken Stew served with hot appams. The gravy was rich and delicious and the appams were soft and readily melted in the mouth. The starters were great! Corn-mushroom-broccoli chilly fry was a crisp, spicy and great dish. Chicken dimsums were mildly spiced and tasty. Dad enjoyed munching on a lot of corn chips :p bad habits die hard. We stuck to the classic cocktails (Cosmo and margaritas) and they were good. Overall a pleasant dinner! Thank you! (P.s. there was no room for dessert) 🙈|positive
Rated If you are thinking of Fine Dine, it has to be Melting Pot. By far, they serve amazing Indian and Chinese cuisine. And this place is true to its charm, providing ultimate and sophisticated Fine Dine Experience with the brilliant taste, top class service, quality of food and the soothing aura. This place is on my favourites from last 4 year and the food never disappointed me, be it Chinese or Indian. They have a vast menu and every dish is worth to die for. ...

Rated A group of 9 + 2 kids. Ambiance: 4.5/5 Food: 4/5 Service: 3.8/5 Value for money: 3.7/5 Everything ordered was veg. The food was nice but felt nothing different, which ended up not justifying the price range of 500+ for subzi. But I would like to add that quantity is sufficiently large. On the service front I believe looking at price range the server must give some space and not come in every two minutes asking for kya lau (what more would you like?) . As people like to spend time together as much as eating at such places. Overall a nice place for lunch/dinner where whatever you order will neither excite you but surely not disappoint you.|positive
Rated Pleasing ambience in the midst of juhu. Though Priced on the higher side it offers value through excellent service and food. A place to celebrate. We had patra chicken which seemed more like an inhouse recipe and the regular Indian dishes. No dish let us down.|positive
Rated A nice cosy place for a family or friends get together. Went there on Sunday afternoon and the restaurant was occupied with groups, kitty parties, etc. The starters, main course were rich in flavours and well presented . Excellent idea of distinguishing veg and non veg guests with green and red coloured glasses and respective fine border on plates. This eliminates all issues regarding fussy veg guests. Service staff very courteous and prompt for up-selling and delivering their duties. The only issue what I felt was their overcharging the guest with 12.5% service charge which according to me is higher than any fine dine restaurant . I think the management should look into the same and come with a solution of not charging more than 10% as it is affordable with everyone. Had given the same feedback on their feedback form but didn't listen anything from the restaurant, kindly look into it. Thanks and keep up the good work.|positive
Rated Visited Melting Pot on a Saturday night, called in at 7 pm hoping to get a table eventually got one at 10 pm. Sat outside where they seat larger groups of people, there was a particularly loud group of people which was annoying at times but I wont dock points since the food was absolutely brilliant. Our purpose of visiting Melting Pot was to consume as much chicken as we could. One of the few places in Juhu where you get really good food at a fair price. The service was good apart from one instance where our server forgot to take down the order of one of us which led to him waiting while the others ate(not me) Overall the place is really good with good food and service. The ambiance is better when you are not sitting close to large groups of people.|positive
Rated Visit Day Date N Time:- Sunday, 31-Jan-16 n 1.30pm.. This place has nice Ambience.. Good Service..n variety of options fr both veggie n Non-Veggie.... Quantity n Quality both match each other... It ws my 1st visit at tis place n would surely like to visit again.. Suggest making Reservation if it's lunch or dinner on weekends.. as it ws full when we visited.. but we had reservation.|positive
Rated This place has the yummiest food ever and a very fine dining family restaurant appeal. The north indian is one of the best i've had. Paneer is super soft. Also the honey noodles with ice cream here is heavenly. A proper family outing hotspot.|positive
Rated Literally anything that you order here will taste excellent. As someone said over the course of the evening, 'you come here for lunch, come here at 6 pm, or come for drinks', you will have a good time! Oh, and they do seafood like no one else!|positive
Rated This place is like my second home. I love the food here, it's very comforting and everything I've tried here hasn't failed to impress. They have good crowd and an excellent vibe. Makes this place an all rounder. The pastas, burgers, drinks, everything is great.|positive
Rated It's in a corner in colaba with wooden interiors. The burgers are a speciality, we tried the Mexican one with fries. The desserts are all good and always a good place to chill at|positive
Rated Lovely place !!!! This place offers amazing range of craft beers with amazing variety if food. Went there on a weekday with my hubby and bro. A cozy place with subtle music. Ambience - 5/5 Food - 4/5 Service - 4/5 Beers - 6/5 ;) Loved it !!!!|positive
Rated It was a normal Monday night and me and my friends decided to visit Woodside Inn. To our surprise we had to wait near the bar for a table. Within 10 minutes we got our table. Since my friends were drinking, we decided on finger food. So we called for Lemon Thyme Canapes- this bite-sized-tart was amazing. Perfect amount of creamy lemon and chicken. Onion rings- One of the best rings I've had! Corn and Jalapeños croquettes- it was perfection. Gooey cheese and spicy. The dip complemented very well. For drinks, I had Peach Ice tea which was bit sweeter than I normally have and My friends had Corona. Definitely visiting again !|positive
Rated Ambience 4/5 Looks like the inside of a Hobbiton Shire house. Cozy woodworks and a warm atmosphere. Food 4/5 The Crab Bruschetta and Chicken Nuggets were really good. Drinks 2/5 Have to a little careful experimenting with some of the international beer here, as a Paulaner I had here was a bit stale and made me sick.|positive
Rated This place never ceases to amaze me... It's a hole in the wall and is always packed! Have been here many a times and it is always great to see the familiar faces that serve you and it is always because of them the place is packed! I was pleasantly surprised at the food this time around. We ordered the chicken tartlets, that were juicy and really well seasoned. Next we ordered the cheese and jalepeno balls, which I must say were out of the world. Lastly we got the cheesy garlic bread, which were better than the hundreds available out there!|positive
Rated Great music and beers on tap, the cocktails were a little disappointing. The pizza was superb and the truffle fries are definitely the best in the city! The stuffed chicken as was okay and the calamari was a bit average. I would definitely go back for drinks and starters.|positive
Rated I was not really keen on going to Woodside considering it is bit expensive but my friend dragged me here n all i can say is for good�?��?.Well,they have a mon-fri lunch menu which is simply amazing and economical.We managed to try all the food with a glass of Sangria and a dessert for just 700 bucks with tax.Not to forget the Spinach Risotto was the best.The service was damn nice and the people catering to us were damn humble.In n out an amazing place for lunch if you are craving for some good Italian food!|positive
Rated What to say about dis place its rating says everything. Old school type ambience. Loads of variety to drink. Friendly to pocket. Food reminds me of London. Burgers have huge portions. Home cut fries and the best colslaw. Fingers chips wer good too A perfect place for weekend relaxation. Wud loved to visit dos place again n again. And to end it we had biscuit ice cream at Rustom s. What a lovely day!!|positive
Rated I've mostly ordered at home, and they've never failed in delivering the pizzas hot. The restaurant has a basic ambience, good enough to eat in. Pizza places actually don't need an ambience, you're there to eat pizza, and get back to your day. My favourites - Margherita - is always a classic. Love the cheese and tomato base. BBQ Chicken and Cheese with Mushrooms - Yum! Pepperoni - Love their pepperoni. Overall - their crusts are great, even if reheated on a pan the next morning, the base puree is enough to keep the bread moist, and their toppings are really good quality. All in all - Awesome!|positive
Rated The best pizza I have ever eaten. I was left absolutely speechless. Everything about the Pizza is absolutely perfect. Be it toppings, fully loaded. Be it cheese, fully loaded. Be it their thick crust which many pizza chains get wrong, perfectly crunchy and tasty. Order any pizza you want, Joey's Pizza will not disappoint. And it does not leave a hole in your pocket. The place is a little difficult to find however, but it is absolutely worth it and a must-try if you're looking for food in Andheri.|positive
Rated THE BEST PIZZA EVER IN MUMBAI !!!! Awesome pizzas filled with toppings to the brim accompanied with flavorful sauces.. We had called for garlic cheese bread - totally amazing And then we had called for half n half barbecue chicken pizza and meat overloaded pizza. True to the name, the pizza were overloaded with bacon, ham, pepperoni, sausages -- a meat lover's dream. we were in pizza heaven and we loved every minute of chowing down the pizzas|positive
Rated Pizza's are amazing, avoid cheese burst/crust whatever they call it at all cost... It's the worst thing ever.... Rest all other preparations are great|positive
Rated Legendary place for legendary pizzas... The best ever... Great quantity .... Superb taste ... Leaves you craving for more ... I think all their pizzas are really good... The all meat pizza is one of my favourites... Oh how I miss you joeys !|positive
Rated I visited Joey's last November after hearing so much about it and reading the reviews. I'm a pizza fan and enjoy delicious thin crust pizzas. Joey's was a huge disappointment. I expected much more after reading Zomato reviews and seeing the ratings. The pizza wasn't bad, but it wasn't out of the world awesome either. It was a normal average good pizza, more suitable for college goers considering the pricing. If you're a thin crust crops pizza lover then Joey's is not the place. But if you're on budget and want a normal good pizza (not considering dominoes and Pizza Hut) then joey's your place.|positive
Rated A small cozy Italian restaurant with authentic taste. We ordered Garlic bread delight, BBQ Paneer Pizza, Spicy Italiana and Arabiatta Pasta. All the dishes were delicious except Arabiatta pasta which was more spicy than expected. Just that there are less options in drinks menu , only aerated drinks are available. Rest its a must visit place for Italian lovers.|positive
Rated Writing this review after quite a long time since I last visited this joint. This place was very much near to my PG and we used to go there almost every alternate weekend to satiate our taste buds with the Italian flavor that they cooked and also we were quite impressed with their name. And sometimes wondered that from where in the world they zeroed on this name? And once asked to one of the staff about the name and he was speechless for a moment before describing that he's a new staff and don't know about the name and only owners can tell us the idea behind it's name. Anyway, we were least interested in it;s name but it was the pasta which always attracts us to their place and we savor the taste as much as we can. Secondly, it was light on the pocket in comparison to other restaurants nearby and also peaceful. So, we go there and discuss a lot of things without giving a second thought that someone else might be waiting. Infact, no one ever waited because of us. Their staff was really courteous and understanding and know their Menu by heart, I would say. In case, you are new in Italian dishes and don't know much except pizza and pasta, they would be your first help for zeroing on any dishes. In short, they are awesome.|positive
Rated Amazing pizzas and decent pastas.. This place used to be m Fav 2yrs ago coz of Lasagne pasta but now it has list it's charm for pastas.. Pizza ortolana is really Fab ! And pesto based soup too|positive
Rated A small place in mulund which can't be noticed easily. Ambience is very simple with a beautiful wall picture. Menu has good variety of italian and mexican, plus everything is either cheap or reasonable. We were three and had Tacos, Creamy Stoganoff Pasta, Pizza Verde, Cream of Mushroom and Corn Garlic Bread (Must have!). Each and every dish was properly cooked! Then, Choco Lava Cake was like cherry on the cake. But they should work on their service, it is slow.|positive
Rated This place is a surprise. Not very noticeable but great Italian food. It's under performance is because of its location. Great job by the chef while setting the menu right and give an authentic taste to food. Will be interesting to see if we can see some outlets in western suburbs as well.|positive
Rated I'd been to their korum mall outlet few years back and loved their chicken lasagne. So thought i'd try out something different this time from their mulund outlet. Since this was a home delivery, was surprised to find a 30Rs "Packaging" charge in the bill. Now there was nothing extraordinary about their packaging, but the delivery guy was from some 'stopby' agency or something, which he mentioned had nothing to do with it. So curious to find out what that charge was about. Now to the food Had ordered their bbq paneer pizza, arrabiata pasta and cheese garlic bread. The pasta was good-ish, and was a bit spicy which i didnt mind. But nothing awesome about it. The pizza hardly had any paneer pieces, was almost non existent. But overall found it ok. The cheesy garlic bread was very average. Many other places offer better ones. Was disappointed knowing how tasty their lasagne is but other things in the menu arent.|positive
Rated Stone oven! Everyday during my commute to office I cross this place and have been wanting to try it . and finally me and my friends decided to try this place. Firstly its a small place with a decent ambience. Service and the attitude of the waiters was good. The chicken BBQ sizzler was the first dish I ordered and this is definitely one of the best sizzlers I had. The chicken breast is filled with cheese and BBQ sauce and when you cut the chicken which in this case was cooked to perfection the cheese flows out making it so mouth watering. The fries and rice along with it was good adding to the succulent chicken sizzler . My friend ordered the pasta and the flavour it had was really toothsome and you can't keep you're hands off it. So of you're in mulund this place is definitely worth your time and money. Cheers �?😎�?|positive
Rated One of those restaurant which focuses on it's food more than the ambience just to make it look exotic. We ordered chilli cheese bread, bbq paneer pizza and continental sizzler. And I must say everything was delicious. The service is quite fast. And most importantly it's very light on pocket.|positive
Rated Heard about this new place opened close-by soo thought if trying it out .. But it was quite a disappointment .. Going by the review on zomato, ordered a few things nd only the paneer barbecue pizza was good. The pan fried vegetables were over tangy nd full of bell peppers with 2-3 broccoli and carrots pieces, this could have been made better. And wouldn't recommend anyone to try out their lasagne. Had heard really good reviews about this place but it was a complete NO-NO for me!|positive
Rated Visited this place on a Sunday afternoon. The place is very nice and ambience is good. The Manchow soup was very good and for starters had ordered Paneer Tikka...which was too good. Had ordered a Pizza for my kiddo and she loved it. It was large and very filling. Then ordered Tawa Paneer with stuffed Kulcha...both very good...alongwith Mojitos which were ok. The Veg Biryani was also ok..overall a good food experience..|positive
Rated One of the awesome place I have been to... Food is extremely nice. The atmosphere is good. The staff isnt curtious enough to get things done fast. At times quantity is also less. Must try: khamiri rumali roti. :P|positive
Rated Ended up here as 'The Food Studio' had a 60 min waiting & this place is really good. A perfect family restaurant. Good food. Very well trained & polite staff. Had a lovely meal here.|positive
Rated My favorite restaurant in Mulund.. A fine dine resto bar.. Great ambience.. Good food.. Good service.. Staff is well trained (they have knowledge about each and every dish they serve) you must try Mughlai food.. Chinese..Continental and Italian won't disappoint you We had sizzlers.. Kabab platter.. Tawa murg Peshawari..good place for non vegetarians... North Indian food is great too.. You can visit this place anytime for good food..:-)|positive
Rated If you are looking for a variety of food and the tasty food then must Visit this Spice lane restaurant which is at Mulund east.Quality and taste of the food was just awesome.We went over there on the birthday celebration of my friend.We all had variety of food like Pizza,Pasta,North Indian food.Starters were so delicious.Ambience was also nice.Service was little slow.But Must Try it.|positive
Rated It can be called A Fine Dine Restaurant at mid range cost. This restaurant is huge located in Mulund, has big seating area. The place is well maintained. Everything from furniture to table linen to decorations, they all appear absolutely new. We went for lunch here, and found that they serve good food, and they have good variety. In case you are confused, take help from their staff they will suggest you awesome food. The service here is very good, they take care of all table etiquettes. They are well groom and courteous. Unlike other restaurants they serve starter and main course in different plates, i.e. they will replace your plate once you are done with the starters. In other similar restaurants they serve main course in the same plate in which you had starters. They have enough parking space, in front of the restaurant. There is a small garden also in front of the restaurant. In my opinion such restaurants should have more visibility.|positive
Rated Had gone for my friend's birthday the hotel is near dmart of mulund. As we enter the hotel the ambience was awesome and on 1st floor on the end there is waterfall. As we go to food firstly we order a cheese corn kebab and machurian dry the taste of both the dishes were too good. Then we order paneer kadai and dal tadka naan n roti with customized pasta as we started eating it felts so yummy pasta n punjabi dishes taste was too good then we order a pizza and the size of pizza was big and was delicious and last but not the least order mocktails which we drink was super awesome. A must place to visit.|positive
Rated Being the new year weekend, spice lane was our only option for dinner party...and it certainly didn't disappoint...Fish platter and chicken Peshawari is a must try..Great ambience and good food...the food service needs to be looked into...Overall a great resto to hangout with family..!!!|positive
Rated Spice Lane is located right next to DMart on Mulund-Goregaon Link Road in Mulund West. They are known for their North Indian, Chinese, Continental, Malwani, Mughlai cuisine. I had been to this restaurant many times & still be visiting often. Sometimes with friends & sometimes with family. Its a nice place which plays soft music. I have tried their Sizzlers, Kebab Platter, Kadai Paneer, Tawa Murg Peshawari. Only issue I felt about it, is their seating arrangement. The sofa's are too low for the tables. Otherwise, its a best place for Mulundkars to unwind after work. This place can be a good option to take someone on a date. eatburp.com|positive
Rated Decent place. Food not that spicy as published. Had to wait for 10-15min, which is fine. The lighting is too dim. Cant actually see whats on the plate. Good family Hotel.|positive
Rated Pathetic service... It took 45 minutes to get soup and starters. Waiters don't seem to interested in you and manager doesn't give attention. The food came was actually quite tasty but not up to the mark...tandoori was watery and soup had big chunks of boiled chicken. Few of us got only one or two pieces of chicken in their soup while others got bowl full of it. Main course was good...and tasty. Mutton was perfectly cooked... Bt the slow service ruined our experience. If you have an amazing patience level.. Then its worth a visit.|positive
Rated We were actually wandering in the area and actually quite hungry when we saw this restaurant. My thoughts for yesterday that we will try a new restaurant which is not that famous, so we went to it. And bingo, it came out to be one of the best in the area, though not frequented by many people. They have two areas, one outside and AC, ambience was quite good and simple but the use of light give it a quite decent look. Staff was really courteous and helpful. Also, they made sure that you order the quantity that you can have, and their suggestions worked really well. As we were only two, so he we don't want to order so much that we wouldn't be able to have. So we ordered pints beer and started our feast with chicken tandoori, later we ordered Biryani. Food : the good thing about then that they cook the food when you order, so it take some time to prepare but the taste overpower everything. The Tandoori Chicken was really cooked well in a good marination, no extra oil or spices, that we found sometimes, and believe me it was the best ever Tandoori chicken for me. Biryani : being a Biryani lover, I always prefer it over anything, and their Mutton dum biryani come out as one of the best of its type, they actually cook awadhi dum biryani, where rice was half cooked and Mutton/chicken are cooked separately and then they layer and dum it, so the taste come out differently than that of Hyderabadi dum biryani or kolkatan, but it's awesome. Mutton was cooked properly, spices were on tandem with the quantity and the best thing, that they prepared it once we ordered. So overall, a good place to be to have some authentic dishes, secondly fresh and cooked the way you want.|positive
Rated I have been going to dream every other weekend. Their family section is very small, they have a separate section inside where they play matches on projector (spacious with nice placements), service there is very bad. Overall the food is good, slightly over priced. You can visit this place once in a while.|positive
Rated Its not a popular restaurant in mulund but one should try it as the food is very good. My friend introduced me to this restaurant n i fell in love with kebabs served over here. They are very well marinated and cooked and the taste just keep whirling in your mouth. The biryani served here is as well good as kebabs. Madira kebab is one of the best kebab i have had till the date.|positive
Rated Nice food and very well managed restaurant. Try the kebabs and Manglorian food served here. They are amazingly good.|positive
Rated Its a really good italian joint in powai. We went for a friday night dinner. The place was packed but we got a table for two in 5 minutes. The staff are quite friendly and prompt. We had The orchiette with bacon ham and smoked sausages which was really really delicious. But i would ahve prefered if the bacon would ahve been a bit more crispy. It would have been a nice to bite something a little crunchy in the sea of pasta,ham and sausages. The mushroom fricassee was something i never had before. I usually love mushrooms so i loved this dish also. My only complain is why is the burger section available only till 7.00 PM!! Burger is a perfectly good dinner for many!|positive
Rated One of the best Italian restaurants in the Powai area... Its child friendly and staff is very helpful in general. For the Veggies - Try out the pizza, pumpkin ravioli, jalapeno fondue. The mocktails are also simply great - try the passion fruit ice tea, guava watermelon..|positive
Rated One of the best places for cheese cake, fondue and pizza. I have been going to this place for more than 4 years now and it never disappoints. This time we went and ordered Jalapeno and Sun-dried tomato fondue and Goat cheese stuffed Mushrooms in Barbecue Sauce and for drinks November Breeze and Virgin Mojito. The mushrooms were sumptuous and lip-smacking while fondue was amazing as always. The dishes were filling so didn't order any main-course. This was the first time I took my husband with me (hes from Delhi and I am from Mumbai) and he also loved this place. If there is one thing I wish to change then its the lighting. Its too dark and frankly the food is not visible. This place really needs to change the lighting arrangement asap.|positive
Rated Nov 5 dinner: We have been to the Khar outlet multiple times and love the food. The Powai outlet is bigger and the ambience is warm and quiet. Jalapeno and sun dried tomato fondue was really good and goes well with your drinks. The stuffed mushroom with goat cheese and barbeque sauce tasted really nice. The flavour of the sauce was not overbearing. The kids loved the herb grilled chicken - not too spicy and neither bland. Among the mains, the cottage cheese steak was good. Also loved the mustard marinated sea bass fish. For desserts, we had tiramisu and mocha fudge cake. The tiramisu tasted a bit powdery and the topping was too hard. We have had much better tiramisu - a disappointment. However, the mocha fudge cake was divine. The service was good. Overall, a nice experience.|positive
Rated I have been to mangii many times , but tried their breakfast menu for the first time. Its a must try menu. We tried baked beans with toast, corn potato rossi, buttermilk pancake, nutella sub, mushroom florentine. Everything was good, except i wished for more nutella and cream filling in the sub. It felt a little dry. It is moderately expensive but worth the money.|positive
Rated This place has been very special n close to the heart. It's a very cute cafe, not very crowded back then. Don't know whats the scene now. But yes nice quite n cute place providing all the good food n soothing music with soothing lighting perfect for long long conversations.|positive
Rated Food - 4/5 Ambience - 3/5 Service - 4/5 Value for money - 3.5/5 We visited this place for lunch after about 3 years. And our experience with food was pretty much the same ie really good food! This place has two sections, Indoor AC and outdoors. The indoor section though needs to be revamped as it feels a tad bit worn out. They give you a complimentary bread basket of assorted breads..really nice and fresh served with butter. To beat the summer heat we tried the mangii signature cocktail st. Tropez smash..very refreshing blend of vodka and watermelon! Next up we had the veg calzone verdure pizza..you can either have it stuffed or as an open pizza (we chose the latter). It's a nice thin crust pizza with a generous dose of veggies. Again very well prepared. Lastly, we finished our meal with Belgian waffles served with whipped cream and berry compote..good portion size and crispy, hot waffles! This meal set us back by INR 1575 incl taxes and 10 percent service charge. Do note that you get jet miles for dining here..I think it is computed as 4 miles for every 100 rupees spent, so don't forget to quote your jet privilege membership number at the time of billing. Overall verdict - Worth visiting for the food but ambience is strictly ok.|positive
Rated Visited this cafe post a lot of recommendations but unfortunately the cafe did not live up to its name. Stuffed chicken was salty and pizza was so sweet we could have ordered it as a dessert. The only saving grace was the buffalo wings. To each his/her own I m never visiting this cafe ever again.|positive
Rated Had gone long back, but did not get time to write a review. So here I am writing short nd quick review., ambience wise this place is awesome... I would prefer outside for little late night dinner eventhough it is very next to busy road Coming to food, I really enjoyed whatever we had ordered I guess it was soup, garlic bread (which I always ordered whenever I find it in menu) and pizza or noodles I am quite sure you will enjoy food here|positive
Rated Exceptional place for a sit down brunch or quiet evening snacks. Superb pizzas and a very strong range of Italian food. Adequately priced for the very ambient atmosphere and a great view of the powai lake. Definitely one of the best sit in cafes in powai.|positive
Rated Had ordered food from this place a few days back. Brilliantly cooked food! Absolutely amazing! Their dishes are priced between 200-300, which is absolutely worth it! We had ordered for a chicken wings, a peanut butter chicken sandwich, pollo penne (chicken) and a chicken burger. All the dishes were cooked brilliantly. The chicken pieces in the pasta were very tender and the patty for the burger; succulent. What impressed me the most was their peanut butter chicken sandwich. I never knew the two things that I absolutely love would taste so well together! The chicken wings were also amazing. The quantity is great, we actually could not finish all up. The delivery was quite fast. Will be definitely ordering from this place quite often.|positive
Rated I ordered a Penne Arrabiata pasta from them and was not happy with the quality of food at all. The pasta was all broken up and and the sauce was extremely dry and lumpy. It looked like they had reheated some old pasta out of the fridge. It did not taste good at all. This was my first experience, and based on this I would not order again.|positive
Rated I am actually on "Super-Diet" kind of thing and looking for Salad to get delivered nr my office. I have order from Sorriso and now I am a regular customer of them.. Enjoying all type of salads.|positive
Rated Food was great. We ordered Penne Arabbiata Pasta with Chicken & Veg Burger. Packing is very neat. Overall Food Quality is very good. Nicely seasoned Pasta. Burger Size was very good and was provided with Mini Nachos. Overall a very good experience. Value for Money considering the Quality and Portion Size.|positive
Rated Well i have to hand it to this place for surprising me, and I mean that in a good way! Found this pleasant surprise on the zomato online ordering platform and went ahead with ordering two meals. And both I would say lived up to its mark. Was ample in quality and quantity both. Delivery was prompt and on the time promised on the app unlike some other online orders i tried that came much later. I have ordered only once but I will surely order again very soon. Thanks Sorisso for the good food!|positive
Rated We ordered their veg dishes - thousand island poutine, Zorba the Greek pizza and Pesto Pasta. Thumbs up to their pizza and pasta. Nice thin crust and lovely flavours, pizza was almost perfect. Pesto pasta too was equally good, but was floating in butter. If you are health conscious, then you want to give them instructions on use of less butter. Thousand island Poutine was just about okay. It's basically French fries with thousand island sauce on it. Din enjoy the dish much. But overall I believe the food was good and worth the money.|positive
Rated If there would be no board , you would never know this place existed , its a hidden gosta , a complete trippy place with a full goan vibe , with awesome burgers there chicken gostana , butter chicken and beef burger are good. Zizou, there cute doggy just makes you smile .|positive
Rated At a friends house in khar , somebody said 'whats that place we ordered from a couple of days back , where the burgers were amazing?' Figured out it was gostana . Decided to order from there .. 35 min later ... Nice packing but not so nice burger . The buns were nice n fresh but inside was just so regular . No innovation at all. Btw i ate the gostana burger. So ordinary .|positive
Rated A small cafe - only for friends ! A close friend of mine took me here. We had been planning of visiting this place for sometime. 1. It's a small place with two cosy tables, loads of games, light music, peace and a playful dog - Zizou for your company. 2. The place is clean and hygienic. Presentation of food is decent. 3. Staff is homely, friendly and courteous. Its gives you a feeling of a friendly neighborhood cafe thriving on relationships and friendships. 4. We tried burgers which were good. It's a good place to chit chat and spend some time with friends. However, good luck locating the place :D|positive
Rated This place is quite literally a hidden Gem and is located behind the building premises that house it. 👽 The restaurant look more like a pub or a place that you go for a drink than a restaurant. There are just 3 tables and seats to host a comfy 10-12 people. We were welcomed by the Owners dog (Zizou�?�) who keep you entertained till you order get ready. The pace is littered with Rock Memorabilia with adds a hint of nostalgia for any rock fan. We ordered 2 burgers i.e. Lamb & Beef Burger both priced at Rs 300. The preparation quite surprised us. The Burger comes with a healthier option i.e. Sweet Corn and salad instead of the traditional oily fries. Appreciate this from the owner. You also have an option of whole wheat and multi-grain bread for your burgers. The beef Burger was the best as the meat was very tender and is well marinated with the sauces. 😚�? The lamb burger is kheema based as opposed to chunks and is pretty good. Con : The only con of this place is the price which is quite steep when you compare it with the quantity. Final Comments: Worth a visit!!!👌|positive
Rated This place is a hidden treasure serving the best quality of burgers. It's featured in kickass burger and hidden gems its 100% correct. I ordered the butter chicken burger it was just fabulous. The quantity of burger is quite filling. The place is very small with just 3 tables but staff is very polite.|positive
Rated It's a tiny little place with only three tables.. hearing the name I expected to be a traditional bademiya kind of the joint but it is actually quite funky with rock music posters, memorabilia and a in house dog.. don't worry the dog seemed to be well trained and well fed :) It's the burgers which give the place it's reputation though. We had three burgers.. the beef burger was made with a mince meat patty and was tender with full of flavours.. the chicken burger was ok.. the patty was a bit dry.. the lamb burger was amazing.. the patty had a galauti kabab taste to it.. all burgers were served with corn.. I would have preferred potato wafers.. This is a definitely a place worth visiting if it's burgers you are looking for..|positive
Rated Firstly I'd like to say that Gostana was so very difficult to find. There wasn't even a good enough sign board to direct us. It is located behind the building premises. Anyways Gostana surely is a promising place. Their burgers are exclusive and differently delicious. Also it's one of the few places in Mumbai that is pet friendly, and they even have some grub for pets. Would surely visit again.|positive
Rated This place is like a hidden treasure! Getting here was a bit difficult, considering it's not on the main road. But with a little effort, we got in. The place has an amazing homely ambiance. Games, musical instuments, books them all.The best part about this place is their Dog Zizou. The food is average. The stuffing in the lamb burger was amazing, with all the spices on point, although the bread seemed quite dry, but with the Raita it tasted amazing. The Gostana Chicken was a little disappointing. The drinks were fairly good. The food may not be over the top, but I'll definitely visit again, only to see Zizou.|positive
Rated I have been a regular here since Gostana first opened in the small lane opp Bagel Shop, then to Pali naka where Indigo Deli now stand and then finally to its now 3 year old spot near Elbo room Bandra. Gostana is literally my second home and strangely I realised that I had never reviewed the food there! . Kind of feels like reviewing my moms food Lol:p I have eaten everything on the menu multiple times and have phases for months when I would only order a particular dish. So starting from my Phase 1 : The Lamb Burger. A stellar "kheema"Ish mutton patty with the Gostana signature sauces available in multiple bread choices, whole wheat, multi grain etc...served with kachumber sauce... Mind blasting! Phase 2: The Egg burger: This is the best anti hangover dish I have eaten. The feel good factor of eating omelette pav on a cold Delhi morning combined with the clean steamed Gostana style! Highly recommended for Eggetarians. Phase 3 : The Hot Dog- The best hot dog I have eaten in India. Honestly the best,! So good that i t gets sold out more often than I get to eat it. Its available in different sauces but I stick to the standard regular flavor. For a bhukkad like me I need 2 . Best for a light meal or an in between snack. Phase 3 : The Buffalo Burger :- Yes its beef but not cow. This was a very loooong phase for me as for about a year I only ordered this . Its my second best dish in Gostana. Its not a beef patty but more like pulled beef kinda vibe... But the sauces and the beef combo is out of the world. Phase 4 :- Uhh I am stuck on this phase for longer than the beef Burger... THE BUTTER CHICKEN BURGER!!!!! JUST EAT IT!!!!!!! The only butter chicken which tastes better than butter chicken in punju restaurants... And coming from a Punjabi trust me on this. For vegetarians try the Butter Paneer burger. My number one dish . ! Highly highly recommended. I can go on and on about the chicken ranada, the hummus, rummus , the salads , coolers etc etc etc... Oh btw all the food is steamed and fat free for the calorie counters. And for all pet lovers you can come with your furry friends . ( I actually met a pet owl there!) So if you want to have a chilled out scene with friends or come for a quiet dinner with your significant 2 legged and 4 legged others come to Gostana. Oh and free WiFi too :D|positive
Rated We've been to PizzaExpress several times in the past. Surprisingly, our friends had not tried this. Pizza in India is still dominated by the likes of dominoes and pizzahut apparently - and mainly home delivery. This is a nice fine dine place that offers the purist Pizza/Pasta. Purist because for instance they don't offer corn as a topping! The Romana (thin crust) pizzas are amazing and we always go for them. You can do half-n-half. The Berry Fresca is a must try in beverages. The one thing to improve would be the menu itself. Some innovation is now overdue and wouldn't hurt. A tad expensive, but the pizzas are well worth it.|positive
Rated We had Dough balls doppio which is pizza express well known dish the dips which are being served with it are good and are perfect combination to have with dough balls 2)Pollo forza We had pollo forza pizza .we wanted to have something spicy and they suggested this one 3)Blueberry semi freddo it was served with cream layer on top blueberry sauce sandwiched in between and blueberry icecream in bottom Overall i would rate 3.5/5|positive
Rated Great place, definitely try the soho. Super service. I am a regular here whenever i am in the city. One of the best quality pizzas inspite being a chain.|positive
Rated We went here on Sunday !! And the place was quite empty..only 3-4 tables were filled up... So we ordered their famous starter dough balls dappio..it got over in 2-3 mins !! Then we ordered Calabrese, the famous Italian pizza the most costliest pizza I ever had till date !! No value for money ... It's too costly.. If your planning to go then be ready to pay 25-30% tax on your food you order 😓😪|positive
Rated This restaurant was very empty with just about 4-5 tables full considering a Friday evening... Wonder how! We started with the ever so famous dough balls which came with three dips... Very soft and melts in your moth... It got over within a minute of being placed on the table. Next we went for a Margarita pizza loaded with toppings... me and my friend wanted different toppings and they refuse to do half and half pizzas :( except for half n half different toppings over margarita! So we took that! Alongside that we also called for garlic breads with cheese. What came on the table was beyond imaginable.. Delicious is just an understatement!|positive
Rated We stepped in here for lunch. The place is quite spacious and open. Food here is awesome. We had 1 watermelon salad, 1 aata balls starter and 1 pizza. They were awesome. We didn't want to rush in so we took our time and sat there. Their starters and pizza are incomparable. Whoever is fond of Italian cuisine, crash in here for sure. We just had wine, so nothing much about the drinks but the combo of wine with pizza felt amazing and really tasty. Service is okayish. It's a little slow sometimes, we had to wait for sometime but as we had enough of time and we didn't want to rush so it didn't matter. But if someone wants to have quick bite, they will have to work on that part too. People there are friendly and efficient. They had proper knowledge of their food on the menu. Ambience is cool. Semi private kind of tables, sofas everything, comfortable sitting and bright lights. I just love this place, I have been to other outlets as well. They have amazing food and good service. Music was light, it was perfectly suiting the cuisine and the time. Overall I would rate - Food - 5/5 Drinks - 4.5/5 Service - 3.5/5 Ambiance - 3.5/5 Cost worth - 5/5|positive
Rated Its okay. Siruated at Times Square in Saki Naka, i found this outlet to be okayish. It was relatively empty on a Saturday evening, a surprise. The person taking the order was not very well versed with the whole Menu and we had to repeatedly tell him to suggest only Veg options. Nevertheless, staff is courteous. My kids enjoyed making the Pizza themselves. The dough balls were good, especially both the Pesto sauces with it. The Caprese pizza and Pesto Promono were bith very good. The Hot fudge with Ice cream was alright. The place isnt for people looking for VFM options though|positive
Rated This place has beautiful ambience and excellent food. Just in love with their pizza and desserts. The staff is very friendly. They have this meal for two which is very good to try.|positive
Rated Hit N Run', nope I am not talking about Salman Khan, it's a new place I have found near by my office. On a lazy Saturday Lunch I have got bored of having normal subji and chapatis and try some kukkad. So, without wasting time I checked it God of Food App Zomato and ordered Chicken Mexican Shawarma, Chicken Shawarma and Chicken Tikka Biryani. Both the Shawarmas are great. Excellent in taste. It was so filling and delicious , although I actually forgot to clicked the pictures of Shawarmas and started having it. Shawarmas are pocket friendly too, its totally worth for money. Chicken Tikka Biryani is average. But in comparison with others, the place and price they've offered it's good. Still I would think they can do it more better. Overall, nice place to eat, quality food at affordable price without burning a hole in your pocket. Also, service was quick and commendable. Reached my order at my office in just 25 minutes. P.S : Recommended try their Lebanese Food.|positive
Rated I loved the shawarma. It was really nice and affordable too. Also for the other food preparation, it was properly prepared. Didn't have much expectations cause I thought they are good at only 'Lebanese' but turned out they weren't bad. A good place for affordable food|positive
Rated Small place, decent set up, good Lebanese food but no ambiance. We tried chicken shawarma, open Dajaj shawarma and Dajaj chicken. Both the shawarmas were good. Well cooked and an awesome flavoured humus. Probably the best humus I've tasted in Mumbai. Light to the pocket and overall a satisfying experience. Also, Mughalai seemed tempting. Will visit for another experience there. Food: 4/5 Service: 4/5 Ambiance: 2.5/5|positive
Rated Great place on the eastern jogeshwari side to grab good North Indian and Mughlai food! For spice lovers, have the Lucknowi chicken and chicken lollipop! Craving for some sea food? Try their prawns in pepper sauce. The only draw back is they sometimes get delayed in delivering their order!|positive
Rated Quick delivery and great tasting food. Surely gonna order again from here. Tried the chicken shawarma and their parathas and they were tasty. Also tried the falafels which were a little dry but very tasty.|positive
Rated Food 4/5 Value for money 5/5 Service 3/5 I ordered from this place through zomato. They delivered just within the estimated time. They forgot to bring us the complete order which is why I lowered the rating. That being said, the food was delicious. I had pita bread with chicken in hummus. It was delicious and more than filling for one person. The hummus was made very well and served in generous quantity. I'll certainly look to order from here again if in the mood for lebanese|positive
Rated I have rated this restaurant,based only on its Panner tikka roll.Never tasted such a roll,just loved it.Eventually I ate 2 of them and also it had my stomach filled.Its not a type of formal restaurant with proper seating and all but food quality is really good.|positive
Rated The usual friday ..order from a new place found on zomato.. it had a rating of 4.. but dunno why didnt like the food at all.. did i try all the not so good stuff from here? Or was it a bad day ? Ordered for a chicken triple schezwan rice and chicken bhuna.. with no traces of chicken anywhere.. it was like a treasure hunt.. but anyway taste of the rice was good and the bhuna gravy was ok.. packaging very basic.. Overall very average food..|positive
Rated Lebanese, tandoor and rice noodles is what this place is famous for. I had chicken shawarma first time in Mumbai and the experience was amazing. I wished i could try something more but had no space left. The most attractive part is the live counter seeing which one cannot wait any longer to grab some of it. A place worth recommmending and try new cuisine....chao|positive
Rated How much ever I'm tempted to use the line 'You should just Hit this store and run'... I can't, because this store has earned it. Ordered in on a lazy night because of lack of hunger (Yes, that happens) and yet ended up ordering a meal, just looking at the wide menu considering it serves Lebanese food. A self proclaimed Lebanese fanatic, my order wouldn't be complete without a nice Chicken Shawarma, some falafel and Chicken sheesh Tawook. Curiosity further led me to order in the hit n Run Baida Roti and right beneath was the menu for kheema parantha that couldn't be resisted. Unlike all times, I wished heartily that the service was slow so that my almost non existent hunger increased. But it was not to be. Commendable Service Time reached us our order in 30 odd minutes, nice and warm. The quantity was not great but then the prices were very below average too, so that kind of nulled it out. All the dishes ordered were great. The Baida Roti is a must try, with mom experimenting with recipes to duplicate it. All in all, this place gives you a good time and tasty food.|positive
Rated Good food , good ambience great music and super sangria !!! Super chilled out place to catch up for food , drinks and conversation ! This one has more space than the Colaba one but a little less charming than that one|positive
Rated Lovely dark ambience. Good food. Tried a new German beer that's not offered at many places. Loved the calamari and spinach pizza. Amazing crust and you won't realise you're eating greens. Do try stuffed mushroom and cheese starter. Paneer Skewers also good for veggies. I always have an awesome girls gossip night here.|positive
Rated This popular place from SoBo has become the go-to place for burbies as well. If you've been to the one at Colaba, you'd walk in with high expectations. and it doesn't disappoint. Woodside Inn has great energy! The ambience, the happy bartenders and the scrumptious food that they serve definitely makes you want to visit the place again. I like their mocktails specially the Rum Mojito. Although their alcohol collection pales in comparison to Salt Water Cafe (haven't seen anything like SWC in the recent past). But if you're a man who loves his Beer and Burger you'll like this place. Have been to this place quite a few times and have tried different dishes hence not naming any particular one. Everyone has a different taste palette that tickles their fancy. The food is good. One thing though - be prepared to wait once you place the order as the food takes a while to come. The staff is very helpful and courteous.|positive
Rated Such an amazing place Awesome music. Good crowd. A little waiting on weekends. We ordered chicken wings and they were fantastic. I have tried their breakfast as well and it is also amazing. Very well cooked eggs with bacon and toast. Love it. Should try it for yum food with good portion size|positive
Rated BIRTHDAY DATE NIGHT :D :D :D The ambience, the music and whole vibe of the place is amazing. It's like a mixture of Bandra's Out of the Blue and Corniche. Love it. We were advised to have their burgers as they're supposed to be the highlight of the place. So we planned on ordering a pizza and Chicken Wings for starters and a Burger and Steak for Main Course. So we started off with ordering the Cranberry and Apple Shake - Uh-Ma-Zing!!! Absolutely loved it, which raised our expectations even more for the food! Then the starters arrived #BarbecueChickenWings. You would expect Barbecue to be on the sweetish side but this was something completely different. I would never imagine it's Barbecue Sauce. However, it was pretty good and we liked it. The #HenHousePizza was next and frankly it was quite disappointing... I would've liked the "thin crust" to be alot thinner and the taste was very average, especially for the price! Since the pizza crust was alot thicker than we expected I got full with just the starters and had absolutely no room to even share a main course. We do however want to try their Steak and Burgers so we will be coming back sometime in the near future. I do hope that changes our opinion of this place. P.S. The service is pathetic here as well! The only reason we had a good time was because we were on quite a jolly mood and the atmosphere was lovely.|positive
Rated Woodside Inn is a popular Pub in South Bombay, this is their second outlet in city. I was there last night with my sister, to watch the match. It's a cozy little eatery serving alcohol, of course located in Oshiwara. They have two sections, inside and the outside. We were initially seated inside for a bit until we got a table outside. The inside section is of a polished bar, with wooden interiors, few posters stuck on the wall. They also have a huge bar table, with stools, which is often the resort when you don't get a table and have to make do until you get one. I particularly enjoyed my time outside. It's got white chairs, white walls with some cutesy art drawn, similar to what to Konkana Sen from the movie Wake up Sid does to her walls; and glass bottles with electric lights inserted and kept on the grass like portion of the wall, the incumbent fence to the restaurant :D What I ordered? Fresh Mozarella and Bell Pepper Stuffed Mushrooms with Garlic Aioli : Perfectly deep fried Mushrooms, studded with Cheese and Herbs and served with a Garlicky - mayonnaise like dip. It goes extremely well when paired with a drink. Ripe Tomato and Fresh Basil Bruschetta - Fresh Tomato, basic on a crispy buttery Garlic Toast. It was crunchy and the fresh vegetables made it a treat to eat! Stuffed Spring Rolls with Edmame Beans, Olives, American Corn, Mozarella Cheese with Bhut Jolokia Mayo - A whole lot Veggies, which you'd usually find in a Pizza stuffed inside a Spring Roll served with the same dip we has with the Mushroom Dish! This dish in all honesty wasn't as awesome as the earlier two. Maybe we're spoilt eating our Desi Spring Rolls, that the Italian one dint appease as much. Verdict It's fun place to step in if you wanna enjoy your evening with some good food. I personally love their outdoor ambience, it's very well ventilated, with enough room for breeze. I'd definitely go back if I'm in Andheri and the mood for a lazy yet a fun place. They also have Karaoke evenings every Wednesday which I'm waiting to try!|positive
Rated In the row of eateries dotting this one lane of Oshiwara, Woodside Inn stands out as my favourite place to chill out with friends. The outdoor seating, though only perfect in certain months of the year, is always full and more so on weekends. I've ordered a multitude of starters here over several visits, all with reasonable success. The rosemary fries are the best in town; the pizza reasonably good and burgers quite nice. I've heard complaints from beer drinkers that they never have enough beers on tap but if you are a teetotaller like me, you will be happy with their house made gingerale. bombayfoodie.com|positive
Rated *Short review* A very nice small restaurant in andheri which is my favourite of all times when it come to eating good food. They a huge variety of mexican dish and it is almost imposible to predict their dishes from the names of the dishes in the menu. But now i am very much familiar to their entire menu. I love the food here. They have some amazing nachos and tacos, they have good sizzlers as well. This place is quite famous amongst the youth. Never a time that i visited this place and returned home disappointed. The food here gives satisfaction to my soul. A highly recomended place for all mexican food lovers..cheers!!|positive
Rated Went here on a late Sunday evening. .. n thankfully managed to get a seat in a few minutes. The ambience is chilled (thanks to the AC :p) ordered for nachos and it was yummy with perfect toppings of cheese, chicken, beans. The mint n lime and kiwi mojito were refreshing. Wud definately visit again as there were many interesting dishes on the menu which i wud love to try....|positive
Rated By far one of the best Mexican restaurants I have ever been to in my life. The ambience was quite pleasant and colorful. Luckily being a long holiday weekend the place provided plenty of seating options. We perched ourselves on the mezzanines and requested for the menus. Going by their suggestions we ordered for the nachos served with beans and a side of cream and salsa. Brilliant!. Followed by garlic bread with olives, corn, pickle and of course extra cheese. Awesome. Followed by the main course which was a peri peri rice with vegetables in gravy. Scrumptious. If I could I would have invited the legendary Rey Mysterio or the late Eddie Guerroro to join me. Most importantly I also had my first brush with a Tequilla flavored Beer!. Aii Caramba!. Overall a great place for excellent Mexican food. !|positive
Rated I don't think I have enjoyed myself so much anywhere else than here! Really cool place to hangout with your friends. It's a Mexican cuisine restaurant which makes this place on of a kind. Really really amazing food and pocket friendly. I have a Jain friend in my group which makes it always difficult for me to choose a restaurant but this place was like the perfect place in all ways. Also great place to click pictures(this is for All the chicks out there :P). They give you their Mexican hat to click pictures. Overall this is a 5/5 place and a must visit restaurant.|positive
Rated Was here during the World T20 India Pakistan cricket match. Requested for a table with proximity to the TV. The guys are really helpful . They got us a table quick. The ambiance & the environment was really amazing. Everyone was shouting, screaming when a boundary was hit. No one complained. The service is real quick. Had a stuffed potato skin starter. The taste is still lingering in my mouth. Loaded with cheese !!! Don't remember the name of the main course dish. But it was baked stuffed enchilada with a nice tomato sauce. The taste was amazing. The perfect balance of tangyness, sweet, salt,spice & cheese. Had the chocolate mud pie . That was nice too. India won the match ! They offered free Dessert to everybody. But , we were so full that we were not able to eat anything else. An amazing, lively place ! Will definitely go back !|positive
Rated It feels really nice when you visit a food outlet for the first time and they offer you exceptional service. Michell Anthony and I really liked the service Mr. Tilak and the manager there provided. Had chicken lazania which is quite famous then tried something new in rice, which was also good. The rates are quite reasonable, but again you will face a high amount of taxes! Mocktails were prepared perfectly. They provided us Nachos and a desert COMPLIMENTARY! so sweet of them. Small place, But very much alive. You will find people having good time and you will have good time too. They have music and TV available to entertainment. Sit inside the outlet and avoid the summer heat. They accept payments by cash and card. Now parking.. it is located in the end of Link Road, so it has a lot of space around to park your vehicle. However, try parking your bike or car in front of the outlet. That is if you get a place. :P|positive
Rated Sammy Sosa sort of played a big role in introducing Mexican cuisine to the suburb.. About 6-7 years back if my memory serves me right..a little before Sanchos (Khar) happened to us. I must confess I'm not a regular here but have visited the place more than a couple of times over the last few years. It will be little stupid to list down every experience in detail. Let's talk about my recent last weekend experience... Loaded Nachos, fries, lamb, garlic bread as starters.. Brilliant as always. Rich Onion Chicken: the jus could have been so much better.. Nevertheless pretty okay. Grandma's Lasagna : just about the right mix of cheese and sauce...excellent. Then comes the biggest disappointment - the dessert. They didn't have the cheesecake we ordered hence a brownie with ice cream was served complimentary. Now just coz it was foc doesn't mean I loved it.. loved the gesture though.. The brownie wasn't goey enough.. Average stuff. Apart from that we tried the apple pie...tasteless.. The crust lacked texture and the filling lacked the basic essence of an apple cinnamon filling. Didn't work for me one bit! The quantities are for a group. Humongous. The service has always been a strong point. Much more than just good. Better than just attentive & friendly. Another strong factor is the availability of international beer brands. Impressive list. They not only serve Mexican but also a whole lot of world cuisine as well. The menu is an exhaustive selection of food from across the world. Not every dish is noteworthy.. The Mexican fare is tad better than the rest. It worked brilliantly when it started but the city has seen a surge of different cuisine restaurants over the last few years. Serving great food with a charming ambience, not every time at high prices. The ambience at SS doesn't justify the prices charged. Not anymore. Time to upgrade a bit.|positive
Rated Great food and service, loved everything I ate here. The ambience is nice. Got a lot of complementary food too, which sort of was like a cherry on top|positive
Rated This exemplary Mexican food place satisfies the hunger pangs. This place has such enthusiastic staff that helps you out with the order and everything they suggested was bang on delicious. They also have a alot of variety in jain food. Coming to the food: Must try the nachos (the beans were perfectly cooked and tasted amazing), the lasagna, the taco bowl (which looked and was actually too filling), the lemon grass mocktail and the oreo shake (which were served in glasses that looked like bulbs - fun crockery). They have fun guidelines on the menu and their food presentation is also really good. The place is well done up and they have seating down and upstairs as well. Huge, filling quantities of food with reasonable pricing is why you should visit this place. Unfortunately they do not have valet but there's a lot of parking space around. Definitely must try this place. It was worth the travel.|positive
Rated Well to start with, I must say, this cafe has one of the distinctive food menu. Food quality is excellent. Staff is good. You have all the goodies like wifi etc. And it's just a great place to hangout!|positive
Rated Super cool cafe in thane.. dont have anything to complaint about...the quality of food is really good followed with wonderful ambiance.. one of my regular joint.|positive
Rated Ive visited Hiranandani one and this one is bit too different with good services and courteous staff. Food is amazing as i mentioned earlier. One should try Veg white (herb cream) Pasta and yes of course their crapes too|positive
Rated This cafe in vasant vihar I had not tried since ages but yesterday we visited this place and took home delivery for red velvet pastry...it is fresh and juicy. ..it's wonderful in taste..cheers..highly recommended !|positive
Rated This place near by has some amazing pastries and cheese cakes but is not very happening for italian cuisine like pastas....love their red velvet and hazelnut relish pastries too much....|positive
Rated I come here every evening to get fat. Its such an amazing place you just can't deny it. Best of all is the crepes. Must try Indian summer crepe, china tank crepe, bbq chicken crepe. In sweet go for Austrian mudpie, hazelnut relish, red velvet pastry. I suggest to try everything.|positive
Rated Lovely place...menu is quiet big lots of options to try from...loved the spicy pita bread..overall nice service as well..shakes are good as well...if u live peanut butter thn it's one of the nicest one to try as well...would look forward to go and try sm more option..crossiants were not tht fresh though..|positive
Rated After months of waiting i finally found the right moment to visit this café . It's definitely one of the hidden gems of thane. Great ambience, lovely and helpful staff. Had gone here for the first time and order a mexican crepe, vegetarian pasta , garlic bread with chilli and cheese and Austrian mudpie. While we were waiting for our order one of the staff members bought us a complimentary chocolate cupcake which tasted just perfect . Along came the Mexican crepe , this was the first time i was eating a crepe and honestly it looked like a dosa to me and my expectations weren't quite high but as soon as i took a bite it was way pass my expectations with the fillings, the cheese , the crepe itself was mesmerising. Overall a lip-smacking and a must order dish off the menu. Then came the garlic bread which was above average with perfectly cooked bread and perfect cheese proportion. The pasta in pesto sause was also great , although i have a doubt the not many people might like the taste of the sause but i honestly loved it. And then came the mudpie...the perfect way to end a meal , just perfect. Going to this cafe there are 2 things you should definitely order.. the Mexican crepe and the mudpie and if u don't ..you'll definitely regret it !! Will return..hungry for more !!|positive
Rated If you are looking for a decent eatery which doesn't have loud music, jazzy set up and which gives you a good feeling about being in a restaurant, then this one is for you. Well set, on LBS Marg which doesn't have many decent restaurants between Kanjurmarg and Bhandup station, this one will make you feel better. A bit high priced, for the location, the food quality is good. Especially the prawn and fish dishes. I wish this restaurant was about 20% cheaper than what it is. But surely on a overall scale, this one has good ambience, good staff and good food.|positive
Rated Cool restaurant...bit high in price but quantity wise it is justiciable...... The food tastes good.quality is also good the ambience is also good .it is actually the restaurant of anantha suite....I had veg but it's non veg platter is very much famous and cheap....|positive
Rated Finally Bhandup gets a decent place for carnivores.. Ordering in from Avanti is so much convenient! They will generate a customer profile for you if you order more than once so every time you dont have to provide address and other details. Talking about the menu, Avanti has variety of options to choose from, Indian, Chinese (Indian Chinese), malvani etc. And till now not a single item that I have ordered has been disappointing. Portions are filling and not to expensive. Ps. I have not visited the restaurant yet but seems like a decent place for an easy meal with few drinks. Anyways there are hardly any dining options from kanjurmarg West till bhandup station, so this is definitely a safe option for some chicken tikkas and biryanis! thenomadicgourmet.com|positive
Rated Had been these place finally after long await.. it didn't let me down.. Food was good.. Service is OK. . But these place is good for people who have non veg|positive
Rated The lobster cooked in 5 spices was really good. The ambiance isn't great. Service is alright. Their Indian food is average too. Just and okay experience.|positive
Rated one of the good restaurant in Bhandup.food taste and quality is good.we celebrated our mom's 60th birthday in their banquet and also my Aunty's 60th birthday on the terrace.arrangements were nice and well in time and it is priced reasonable.one can try this place for sure of you are located in bhandup east or kanjurmarg east and West.|positive
Rated Its a new restaurant..not know by many...but it will surely not disappoint you. Food here is very nice..both veg, non-veg dishes are very tasty...Ambience is quiet decent and services are prompt. Rates are also nice, we were seven of them and along with hard drinks it costed only around 4000. Good place to go with frnds as well as family|positive
Rated I've been to this place quite a number of times and had also hosted my parent's anniversary & my b'dy party at Anantha Executive/Avanti. Firstly, talking about the FOOD: The food here is good in quantity and quality as well. Variety of cuisine is available here. Particularly good for non-vegetarian food. Seating area is not so big but not too small also. Overall the ambiance is good. Good food and it's proximity is the only reason why we visited this place often. Now you'l must be wondering why have I rated this place 2/5 inspite of everything being good enough? The Reason is : QUALITY OF SERVICE. I was never satisfied by it's quality of service. We hosted 3 parties here. No change. It just degraded after every visit whether it be a small family dinner or a party of 100 people..! Even after giving so many chances, there is no hope for improvement left. I have black listed this place and will never visit it again. The main reason for this decision is the blunder that recently happend on my mom's b'dy party. We were around 18-20 people out for family dinner, out of which 2 were non-vegetarian's and the rest of them were pure vegetarian's including me. So we ordered food and the non-vegetarian's were sitting on a seperate table in the corner end besides us. It was clearly told to serve non-veg only to those two people. Here comes the star of this incident, the 'overly anxious Waiter'. People around us too were complaining about the service that day. A corporate team's dinner was going on in our adjacent table who also had issues with the service. After us, another family complained about their service. So back to what exactly happened.… I had ordered garlic hot pot rice & many other vegetarian dishes. I was served something which was not what I had ordered, saying it was garlic hot pot rice. When I saw the bowl,there was some green colored gravy in it and no rice…!! (it nowhere looked like garlic hot pot rice) I called the waiter and immediately returned it. We already knew the service here is not so good. I told the waiter, it's ok… we don't mind if u get the food a little late, but please get what we ordered..be calm and know the dish what u are serving.…!!!! But it was of no use. He just had to rush. I don't know what was going on inside his mind, but he was not at all looking stable and clear in his head…! Finally the food came. The same waiter again, started serving in a hurry (pata nahi kaunsi train pakadni thi) and even after asking 2-3 times he did not say the dish's name to people on table1. Then he came to my table, I asked him what dish is it, (he did not answer for the first time..i ddnt let him serve me until he answered) finally after a big pause,he said it's some paneer ki sabzi( I don't remember the exact name now) and again it was not looking like paneer ki sabzi especially the pieces in it. So I ddnt take it. When my mom ate it, she realised that it's not paneer but a non-vegetarian dish. By the time she realised this blunder created by that stupid waiter, we all were served with non-veg except the 2 non-vegetarian's :P Many of us had it too. Mistakes happen and we did not make it a big issue. Asked him to change our plates, carefully examined and ate the food served later, paid the bill and left after reporting this incident to the management there. Though we all were laughing on this incident (which made mom's b'dy indeed a memorable one), but I really felt bad for my grand-parents who had never tasted non-veg in their entire life and had it by mistake because of that stupid waiter and his carelessness. (inspite of being pointed once by me and many others about serving incorrect food) I took it as a learning lesson and now i'm even more cautious. I had to share this incident so that you'l be aware too. Choose wisely, EAT well.. THANKS FOR READING.|positive
Rated After searching some restaurant in Bhandup near Neptune Magnet mall, we decided for Avanti. Good and soothing ambience, staff was very courteous and prompt service. We ordered Chicken sweet corn soup, nalli nihari, chicken tawa fry, butter nan, steamed rice, chilli chicken and ice cream. Chicken tawa fry was cooked with egg and tomato garnish, spices were mixed well and overall good cooked. Nalli nihari was not up to the mark but taste was good. Butter nan was the best and soft. Chilli Chicken was really spicy but taste was awesome and cooked with a taste. Overall, nice experience to be there. A recommended place for those who are looking for a peaceful evening with good food.|positive
Rated Sugar sins u rocksssss !!!! Guys don't count the calories 😜 just collect the memories ...... Walnut cake is awesome .... must try it ..... loved every bite of it .... �? Cheersssss to sugar sins �?��?��?�|positive

Rated Finger licking brownies in walnut, Oreo and choco chips variations Highly recommended for birthday cakes Cup cakes are the favourite of my kids Amazing place|positive
Rated Delicious desserts, Wonder to see my angles happy movement with SugarSins. Wonderful test and balance for the sweet conscious people. Recommended to try multipal times|positive
Rated Absolutely fabulous desserts. Their cakes and cupcakes look so delicious and sinful. Amazing variety too. I personally recommend the brownies! Way to go SugarSins�?��?|positive
Rated Excellent desert option. Perfectly baked cakes. Try the cake here & you won't go anywhere else. Absolutely divine. SugarSins simply rocks. MUST TRY..|positive
Rated The dark chocolate cake is literally the best possible sugary sin :) its rich, its dark and its finger lickingly delicious. Loved every bite of it!|positive
Rated Amazing place ! For those who have a sweet tooth , look no further than sugar sins ! They have a very elaborate menu. The dishes here are executed and presented so perfectly that it's a feast for the eyes as well as the stomach. The chocolate truffle Cake is simply divine ! Mind blowing flavours �?��?|positive
Rated Mocha Madness is truly awesome!! Loved every bit of my piece of sin ;) Even the everyday banana walnut cake was a big hit..the best part though is that everything tastes soo fresh..sin on!!|positive
Rated Located on LBS Road Bhandup. Pretty crowded place on peak times. They have different sitting arrangements, AC and the outdoor which is on top of the restaurant. We took outdoor seating for the ghazal. I always prefer such environment whenever it's available to enjoy. We had non veg dinner here as restaurant is specialist in non veg food. We had ordered chicken crispy too which was nicely cooked. The dish I like most is Jhinga Tandoori, it's amazing and very very tasty. I'll suggest you to try out this dish at least once. At the end we finished with sizzling brownie which was mouth watering. Menu has so much variety in it to taste. This restaurant is bit on costly side but I'll say it's worth it. Waiter and other staff are good. I'll suggest you to go early else you could have to wait to get seated. I'll recommend this restaurant.|positive
Rated The ambience is good ... Roof top guess only place which is there lbs road.. It's typical North Indian cuisine nothing new about food ... The reason to visit this place is the ambience ... Nothing new about food and service|positive
Rated The place is just off the LBS road, Bhandup at the ground level itself very much easily located. All praises for the ambience, the seating is divided into two ways, one is the outdoor and the other one is the AC section which is actually surrounded by the outdoor seating. I actually prefer the one outside because of the live ghazals in the evenings. Also at times there is live screenings of matches. The menu they offer is pretty good actually but the food could be better in my opinion. Do try Bhuna Ghost. Service is prompt bo issues with that. Prices bit on the higher side.|positive
Rated Had ordered food from this place. The staff was good enough to guide us through their menu and their best preparations. The food is decent. Can surely go to try the sea food at this place.|positive
Rated Jhinga is prawns? Hope u knw this wen u visit this restaurant,as thats what the waiter first asked me wen i ordered tandoori jhinga.. Goid food, four different seating options to choose from (rooftop, candle light, family room n open seating), live ghazal and good service.. Try their achari chicken kabab, tandoori jhinga, dal tadka, butter chicken..|positive
Rated New addition to my favourite list, especially for family dinners.Well the north Indian food is awesome and leaves you wondering on what to pick and choose. And here comes the best you have multiple options as far as the ambience is concerned, a roof top open air with dhaba type sitting, a/c restaurant etc.|positive
Rated It's a hidden gem within Bhandup. We loved everything ordered starting from Chicken Lung Fung Soup, Masala Papad. Delicious it was. We had also ordered non veg kebab platter which I found it to be ok. Nothing extraordinary here. Coming to chicken Hakka noodles we all absolutely loved it. I am gonna try it again next time I come. In the main course we had chicken kadai, gosht rogan josh, stuffed kulcha, keema paratha and chicken biriyani. Everything was great. It's pretty decent on the pocket with all these coming within 3k/-. This is a very good choice especially for the Hakka noddles.|positive
Rated Shera has a variety of non veg food items with them !!!! Chicken kabab and chicken handi is totally mind blowing super spicy lover will really enjoy the stuff!!!!|positive
Rated Today been to Shera for one more time to have dinner. This is special at evening and at weekends. The live ghazal singer makes the evening nice. Food is nice. Always had non-veg here and it's great. Today tried veg and that also satisfied. Try kebabs and asked them for their specialities. They do recommend good dishes. Must visit place and repeat too.|positive
Rated Another place in Bhandup perfect for ordering in! This place serves only vegetarian and a huge variety of vegetarian items I must say! My favorite is their cheese biryani.. It is LOADED with cheese and the quality is consistent. You can also order Chinese (indian), North Indian and south Indian food from here. Tip: try calling their yummy uttapas and dosas in the morning when they open for business. Perfect for Saturday mornings when you are recovering from a hangover :) thenomadicgourmet.com|positive
Rated I have been ordering from Gopala Bits & Bytes for a few months now. They are quite reasonably priced but the food quality, to my experience, is quite below average. I usually order Veg Biryani or Pulav and the rice when you order from here is not well cooked and tends to be a bit chewy. But possibly the non rice items may be better and I have not tried them.|positive
Rated Don't expect the great quality like that of Kanjurmarg branch. But it is good for fast food. Service is fast eight. And accepts food coupons.|positive
Rated I had been visiting this place more than 7,8 time but one thing I had noticed is that the service is quick!!!! U don't have to wait a long time for the food !!! Ac and non Ac section they have got , cost is also very reasonable !!!|positive
Rated Decent place for a quick bite. The south indians dishes are likeable, the North Indian cooking is average and the seating is not very comfortable in the non AC dining.|positive
Rated As the name, this place is good for a quick bite. 2 floors : no a/c on the ground floor, first floor is air conditioned. Food Quality: Good. Service: Fast. Ambiance: Decent. Multiple Cuisine, Serves Non-Veg and it's pocket friendly. You can go with your family. Happy Eating :)|positive
Rated Good restaurant and cheap rate if you order online.. Anyways you can go for long chit chats Its is a paradise for veggies.. Giant paper dosa and chole bauture must try|positive
Rated So, this is my daily food ordering restaurant, as I live very close by. The food is decent, and can be generally a bit spicy and oily. However the service is good and fast and the rates are very reasonable too. Have ordered lots of north indian dishes as well as chinese dishes from the restaurant. I have generally not been too disappointed, although I do think it makes North Indian dishes better than Chinese ones. Will recommend this for anyone in Bhandup looking to have a decent snack at a decent buck.|positive
Rated You get a divine feeling at the entry of the restaurant itself. There are chants of Hare Krishna in the background. The food was wonderful and delicious. The servings per plate are mighty good. Rainbow soup is a must try if you are a Chinese fan. Lemon chilly potatoes and Corn Crispy Kebab was very nicely done. Highlight of the evening was Rangeela Kebab and Paneer Lazania. Just the perfect dishes to go with the Rotis Basket. Sizzling Brownie added to the happy dining experience in the end. Full marks to this place !|positive
Rated Satvik food it is... Without onion & garlic.. It's a treat for vegetarians .. Love the food panner dishes are awesome to taste ... Biryani is good and love the starters Even the kulfi which we ate ease awesome|positive
Rated Cheap... best ... veg food... though not being a big fan of veg cuisines.. i liked gopala's a lot.. the service is good.. and i even order online... the gopala's veg kitchen is better as people say.. but this branch is also worth the try...kudos..|positive
Rated Coming to this restaurant, the ambiance is awesome. Excellent service provided by the staff, very courteous and warm welcoming. Paneer was soft and had an awesome tangy taste with purple cabbage, yellow and red bell pepper. Quality of ice cream was also awesome. Ambiance 4/5 Food 4.5/5 (excluding North Indian dishes) Service 5/5. Cost- Quite reasonable. Overall in the end when you leave and ring the bell," Hare Krishna, the staff exclaimed!" Worth a visit|positive
Rated This is the best place for ordering Kashmiri Pulao from. I have never tasted a Kashmiri Pulav as good as this one before. All I had to do was order from their official website and they delivered the food to me in a matter of a few minutes. I even loved their Kashmiri Dum Aloo, which is as good as the authentic Kashmiri Dum Aloo. You should try eating at this place at least once, especially if you are a vegetarian foodie like me.|positive
Rated After hearing a lot about this place we decided to place an order online and were heavily disappointed. We ordered a barbeque mushroom and baby corn as well as sautéed vegetables and a paneer Angara. There was little or no taste in the food. The sautéed vegetables were just tossed veggies. Nothing in them. Was more like a vegetable salad than a starter. The mushroom and baby corn wasn't grilled enough. The masalas were very raw. Coming to the paneer, it was okay. Nothing special considering what I had heard about them. Probably was a bad day for them which happens, but if I'm paying for something I would rather have good food and service.|positive
Rated The cousins couldn't meet at Diwali, due to exams, so we decided to go out for dinner this Sunday. I had been to Gopalas earlier but I vaguely remember. So coming to this restaurant, the ambience is awesome. Excellent service provided by the staff, very courteous and warm welcoming. Coming to food, We had ordered the jain lemon coriander soup. It had a perfect taste and quantity of vegetables in it. For starters it was paneer chilly dry. Paneer was soft and had an awesome tangy taste with purple cabbage, yellow and red bell pepper. One of the best I've ever eaten. Seekh kebab was good with fillings containing peanuts and cashewnuts. For the main course we had ordered a rice pot. The best of the best. The taste was a class apart. Triple schezwan rice with gravy was okkish. We had ordered a jain phillipano. It was awesomeeee. It felt like having more of it infinitely. Brocolli, red bell pepper, jalapeños and other topping were perfect. Dil bhar ke daala tha or dil khush kar diya. In the end the falooda looked delicious and tasted nice. Ambience 4/5 Food 4.5/5 (excluding North indian dishes) Service 5/5. Cost- Quite reasonable. Overall in the end when you leave and ring the bell," Hare Krishna, the staff exclaimed!"

Rated On a Friday evening while we were driving in this vicinity our hungry stomach made us look for a eatery. There in the passing was Gopala's Next. I looked at it from the exterior and declared it like one of the regular udipis. In two minds about this place we reluctantly entered. The place was done pretty well to my surprise and had ample seating area spanning across two levels. The decor was done neatly keeping the essence of southern indian in mind. Well lit up this space is done in wooden furniture with comfortable seating. The staff wears a tika on their forehead to continue the southern feel. Started with a manchow soup. It was well made, good in favour and texture, served with baked (not fried) noodles. It tasted pretty well and we cleaned off our respective bowls. Paneer chilli followed site since the first Chinese prep was nice. Again made well using soft, juicy paneer. Right amount of flavouring with sauces, cabbage, spring onion and importantly finely chopped garlic. Pav bhaji was the conclusive dish and this is where they lost points. It was just a little below average. I felt let down while tasting pav bhaji after the first two finely cooked dishes. It was freshly made buy did not taste great. In the interim, masala papad was also ok, we added chat masala to make it better. The rating they have earned is because we did not go with a lot of expectation and had a nice experience. Ambiance: 3.5/5 Service: 3.5/5 Food: 3.5/5 Overall: 3.5/5 gluttonyreviews.wordpress.com|positive
Rated Looks like cheap horror film set. Nothing was enjoyable here..i dont understand how people come here for party and dance to the tune. totally avoid it|positive
Rated One of best hukka lounges in vicinity. Been here a couple of times. The sheesha is worth every penny, the staff is well behaved and the ambience is mind boggling! After several revamps, the final made lounge is not the open terrace disappointment with the nosy manager who sits on your head asking you to pay nor the shady dark room with no proper staff.. It is a nice renovated place with a trippy ambience. You're sure in for a good time once you are here 😉 That's all from my side. Rest you all can experience for yourself😊|positive
Rated For me this place is not cup of tea. I personally don't like everything in UV where you can't read your friends expression but you see is just their teeth. Hence no visuals. Loud music! I can understand why bars has loud music because it makes the consumer high and dance, but sheesha is just for a kick and chat with friends. But cant chat and listen. Moreover hukka there is not economical as well. Just ok. Not impressed.|positive
Rated Good Ambience and the place is also quite good. They even changed the coal of sheesha periodically without any requests. Prices are also cheap. Sheesha was good. Overall a nice place to visit.|positive
Rated Ppl dont go by older reviews. The place is as it is in the photos uploaded. Truely amazing ambience n the best hukka served. Unique flavours , nice music n co operative staff. Led hukka , AK 47 n many more new and funky hukka pots. Highly recommended place to visit.|positive
Rated Very good place for chilling with friends ,sheesha is also nice and hv a lot variety of flavours good service and ambience,njoyed a lot ......|positive
Rated Awesome place. Liquid fume as a brand is always known for serving wonderful sheesha and specially karan who is a brand ambassador of hookah in the city. The variety of flavours is just an awesome feature of LF.... Ambience and fresh EDM collection. What else do you need ? Visit this place ane enjoy. Cheers !!!|positive
Rated A Hookah joint in Mumbai is something to savor on. Nice ambiance a very decent place to chill and relax. Amazing option for weekend break!!!|positive
Rated One of the best hukkas joints in mumbai with loads of variety...worth the visit...quick service..good food...easy to locate...#LoveLF #Hukka|positive
Rated Place is too good and the sheesha also. Only the problem is they don't serve food with sheesha as they have separate zone for smoking. Overall a good experience. And after a long time such a good place for sheesha in central line.|positive
Rated When I entered here ,this Dhaba was almost full even on an odd day which tell you how good it is in terms on its taste even after having a bunch of good restaurants just near by it. As most of the people have already made their comment on the ambiance which is not so great but not disappointing as well, 'TASTE' is what attracts you here. Both veg as well as non veg starters were good. But paneer malai tikka will be sweet rather spicy. Rotis could be more crispy. Overall a very good experience. Typical dhaba feel in terms of ambiance and food. Rarely you get to see this is in a city like mumbai. Would surely visit again.|positive
Rated Great place to order food. We were at Kanjurmarg and called for delivery. We were not expecting the food to be really great but to our surprise it was awesome! We ordered for Paneer hilltop, Veg kebab, mushroom tandoori, stuffed Aloo, chicken seekh kabab, chicken tikka and prawns fry. Everything was great!|positive
Rated If you are looking for an authentic dhaba like feel , this is a great place to be. Not recommended if you prefer great ambience , because this place actually feels like a roadside dhaba. The food is good, and good enough quantity to fill you up. This was the first place I tried a keema parantha at , and it was good. The mutton seekh kebab and the tandoori chicken not so much. A one time try for sure , though a lot of people I know swear by the quality of its veg food ( unfortunately which I didn't try ).|positive
Rated A true blue dhaba within the town for some great non veg food. If you are a sucker for ambience and hygiene then this is not the place for you. If you are short of cash but still want very good food then this is the place for you.|positive
Rated Dhabas are always my favourite. The servings are great. They leave you satisfied and happy. Ordered chicken biryani. Had only one piece of a chicken which was disappointing. The amount of rice is a lot so two people have to share it but aint got no chicken to give to ur buddy 😟 Zinga biryani. I dont order prawn biryanis because i prefer eating homemade. But this was really good. The prawns were a little hard but the flavour was too good. Took roti with a mixed vegetable. Its got a really homely flavour but you can see the excess oil. But then again dhabas are for the heart and soul. Not for your body 🙈 The fish fry here is so good. Its fresh , soft and perfectly coated and fried. We always take away chicken tangdi kabab. As usual great and juicy. Love love love this place.|positive
Rated This place is located on LBS marg behind shangrila bus stop and is a classic dhaba setup. I've been here a few times. Recently came to know that they also do home delivery so decided to order from here. They serve amazing starters and mouthwatering parathas. Their kheema paratha is out of this world and is definitely a must try. The food is delicious and value for money. Their service is also fast. The only down side is of this place is hygiene. Overall tasty food, quick service and pocket friendly.|positive
Rated Dhaba in Bhandup quite surprising.Interesting place it is it just give a feel of that you are in Punjab.It serves veg non veg both and it's value for money too.No alcohol available here.Must Try - PARATHAS, and STARTERS. Don't Try - RICE Ambiance 1/5 Service 3/5 Food quality and quantity 4/5 Hygiene 3/5 Taste 4/5 Thank you tc enjoy|positive
Rated been their some time last week. a typical daba setup.odered tandoori chicken, prawns fry, mutton masala all food very delicious!!!! perfectly cooked price wise alsopocket friendly.Kheema and roomali roti are great.only minus point do not visit this place if you are too hygiene cautious .|positive
Rated SUPER kebabs! Must visit for their delicious juicy kebabs. Try the kalimiri chicken and their kali dal. The mutton too is well cooked, the food takes a while to come so order quick! The staff is super and friendly. Love this place..|positive
Rated Went this place on suggestion. Saying tandoori is speciality it is decent not upto mark chicken was fresh bt nt tender enough with masala nt marinated properly whch makes it less spicy its served with green chutney made up of corriender leaves pudina and green chilly used in small qty. leavng more taste of pudina. Also had paya soup which was too decent felt like having maagic masala soup combined mixed with other masalas making it paya soup.|positive
Rated Had been to this place for a nice punjabi dinner after i was back from cochin...Good place the interiors are well done have khatiyas to sit walls have punjabi dancers painted onto them. So we took the seat with a khyatiya. The place has upper level also but couldnt check it out as we were seated at the ground level. Our orders: Starters : Chiken tandoori lolypops and chicken reshmi kebab. Both of them was delicious along with the green chutney and the salad. Main course: Butter chicken and (dont remember the dish name) but it was very tasty and normal rotis and butter naans. Brownie points for the rotis because they were perfect soft wheat rotis Chicken Biryani was the saddest of all as it taster more of the dry spices a strict no no We didnt have any desert even though took home chinese parcel for my sister whom i had conpletely forgotten was hungry at home Delivery time: Very slow took around half and hour to reach our table and again quite long for roti repeat orders In and all a ok ok place to eat if you consider the taste of the good food.|positive
Rated This hotel is opened just before 3-4 months back. Here is why I will not go there again. 1.we order chicken masala and we received a dish with sweet flavoured masala. 2. We told the owner and asked for spicy masala, he brought the masala which was again sweeter than previous dish. 3. We had ordered chicken chilli as starters which he bought after serving the main course to us. May be some ppl like that, I don't.|positive
Rated A good place to hangout with friends with a decent seating arrangement. Located close to my work place,its a good option always. The platter here is good with ample quantity,worth having. The chicken lollipop was disastrous, with not well fried. In main course we had butter chicken,mutton hand I. Quantity and quality both was value for money. Hope to visit it soon again.|positive
Rated Nice tandoori food... The mutton sheek and fish tikka was really great.. Quick serving and place is also decent and neat ... Cost is also nominal ??|positive
Rated We ordered a light dinner of chicken liver & pota mix starter, paneer bhurji and tandoori rotis. Paneer was fresh & bhurji was tasty, home cooked style. Chicken liver-pota mix was yummy too. Rotis were made of wheat, soft & fresh. Food arrived in time. Had a satisfying meal. It's your go to place if you like simple food without too many trimmings. On an earlier occasion, we have tried the reshmi tandoori chicken, which is delicious too.|positive
Rated I have ordered a few times. Good food. Tried d butter chicken, chickn tandoori, pota, chkn bhuna...all good. Service is ok....delivery does take a bit time. All in all a good place.|positive
Rated From outside it looks like a very casual dining place but there AC seating area is good and gives you a feel of fine dining area . Like any other veg restaurant this too has various menu option of multiple cuisines. I find this place as good family dining restaurant.|positive
Rated Ordered paneer butter masala.... Butter naan and veg jalferizi .. Taste was really good. Price is also ok as per quality of food they deliver. Overall good experience. Vegi u can opt this place..|positive
Rated Been here for a family party, they have an open roof option too. South Indian food that we ordered was good. It's a good option for pure veg dining.|positive
Rated The quality of food has been reduced heaps and bounds! Regular family restaurant with regular non-ac section on the ground floor and ac section on the 1st floor. They even have an open party hall for small gatherings and birthday parties. The food quality here was amazing when they 1st started out but then they just lost their charm over the years. Can always go here for a quick bite if your with family.|positive
Rated Nice cozy place. Have tried the paneer tikka masala, butter naan, dal tadka and jeera rice here. The food is just yummy. The price is of the dishes is reasonable!!|positive
Rated Awesome food and most important the hotel was light on pockets too. Service was remarkable and waiters were too good. Home delivery is very fast too..:)|positive
Rated The food is good...specially the pavbhaji..have tried most of the items here..and they do a good job..the home delivery service is also quick..and dats the bst part..|positive
Rated I am writing this review just for restaurant part of it.. This one serves descent quality of Tandoor food. I personally prefer tandoori here which Is quite lovely! Good place to hangout with friends if you are on nearby Mulund area. It is just beside the Nirmal lifestyle Mulund.|positive
Rated Restaurant and bar at sonapur signal.It has family as well as bar section.Food served here is both veg and non veg and the quality and quantity is good too.. With reasonable price.. Visited here for the first time and it did not disappointed us so you all should go and enjoy the diner here.. Suggestion to hotel - Service is not up to the mark Click below and explore the photos.. Thank you take care|positive
Rated It's right at the corner of the signal but don't worry about parking they will help you out. Not a typical bar but a good restro with a bar option. The food here is decent... We had chicken lollipops, it was decent. Had good portion of chicken in it. You can order anything from the tandoor option it's amazing. It has a family section upstairs.|positive
Rated I think it's the last restaurant in Bhandup towards Mulund, tucked away at a corner of LBS Marg. Went through different reviews after checking into the restaurant. So in confusion I ordered my drink and while thinking for the starter, they came with the complimentary peanut and chips, which is surprising as I never got any complimentary snacks in Mumbai so far. But anyhow I ordered my snacks that's again peanut masala and it was not bad. And went thoroughly to their menu and as usual ordered for Mutton biryani. Though, I didn't get the brilliant biryani at par the standard I am searching for, it was not bad and at least better than any other restaurants in Bhandup. Mutton was fresh and delicately cooked. Rice was also cooked well and looked better. And yes, they are very pocket friendly. Staff was very courteous and helpful. Overall, a good place to spend some time if not full. Yes, not to forget, though, they are not famous and popular but they do know about service and presentation, look at the photos of their plates, they have delicately carved their name in to it and it's rare and you can find it only in top restaurants. For me, it's first case in Mumbai so far.|positive
Rated let me start with the restaurant image which honestly is not very great but little do they know about the food this place serves. located at a not so famous location and bar setup as well, this place is surely to give you doubts about the food... let me tell u they have one of the best sea food and nonveg dishes to offer. butter chicken, fish curry, tandoori, are definitely a must try.. Vegeterians... dont be disheartened as there is an array of dishes for u'll as well. the signature shaam savera and palak khichdi is simply irresistible and a must... hit this place with ur family (in the family section.. lol) and u will definitely fell in love with the food... drawback if any can be the service time... but can be ignored... cheers.|positive
Rated Have been here once when I went to watch a movie at Nirmal. Thw drinks here are priced very reasonably and the food also is pretty decent. Good place for hangout with friends, but not with family i would suggest.|positive
Rated I have been to this place many times n it has never disappointed me. Food is excellent and the price is reasonable. True value for money. Order any thing and it will satisfy you. Service is also good.|positive
Rated Very Good Food along with prompt service the management is really very friendly amd helpfull. Nice party hall on the first floor can accomodate almost 100- 120 people.|positive
Rated A good place to hangout with friends... Decent taste with reasonable price. Best part is they accept food coupons for drinks as well (done by very few in mumbai). The restaurant is open till 2am and they also take order till 1.30am. The service is also quite decent for the price range it is in.|positive
Rated Excellent Mangalorian fare of Sukka Chicken and Kori Roti, with decent North Indian at a very decent price. I have been a regular "home delivery" customer and have never been disappointed with their food at their service.|positive
Rated Good food , and yes it has the authentic taste which is reallllyy spicy and good to eat . Somewhere the quantity was a bad affair . But good place for home delivery and must try is the mutton and chicken thali .|positive
Rated Authentic Malwani food at very reasonable price and simply yummy. The delivery is also quick. Bangda Bhujane was really delicious.|positive
Rated Good place to enjoy kokani food. Quantity is good as well quality. Good place to try nonveg kokani thalis. Service is little slow, but bearable. Food is fresh at least in thali menus.|positive
Rated I'd been meaning to order in from this place for a while. Until I decided to go ahead and do that the day before. I called in for a Chicken Biryani, along with a Chicken Liver Masala. (What can I say, I like extra meat!) Both, the biryani, and the curry, were delicious, and that's not something I say about everything I eat. They weren't out-of-the-world delicious, because frankly, there's a lot of better coastal food out there in the world. But at least for Bhandup, where I haven't come across many other this was excellent. The only gripe I have about their food is the amount of oil that goes into it. I'd probably have loved the liver even more had I not seen a layer of oil on top of the gravy. But I suppose that's just a personal preference. All in all, I'd recommend this place.|positive
Rated Yesterday we had visited Kokan Swad. I heard lot about the place. Just started on November with New staff. Its an authentic place for Kokan dishes. At one time around 40-50 peoples can have meals. I ordered Dal Khichadi with Bobil Fry. My wife felt the Quantity is very less compare to the price. But taste was good. Bobil Fry was very crispy. Service is little bit slower side.|positive
Rated Very slow service ordered thali it took more than 20 minutes to arrive. But taste was good fish fresh. Must improve in service a good place for Konkani food in bhandup. Will try again|positive
Rated Bang opposite Bhandup station this is an udupi place just as the name suggests. Not much to talk about interiors or ambience, you get what you pay for ie. delicious South Indian items. Madras cafe's USP is the location and opening hours. It opens early in the morning, perfect for hot kaphi and dosa. I have called their food at home as well. The delivery is quick and items arrive fresh. Perfect for a sunday morning breakfast! thenomadicgourmet.com|positive
Rated Visited to this place , I started with idli and vada with sambar. The idli was soft vada was well cooked however the sambar taste was something different. May be its my taste I like a particular type of sambar. Then 2 v Mallu ppl only like Sambhar & Chutney which is cooked at home, & v mostly avoid southindian foods in restaurant. then It was missing Something. Then I had Masala dosa with coconut chutny it was very spicy could not finish it. Service was slow Ok Ambiance South Indian food lovers can visit to this place will love it.... Thank you|positive
Rated Good for South Indian breakfast dishes. The Vada Sambhar, Idli Sambhar, Rava Masala Dosa, Mysore Masala Dosa and other Dosas are good. None South Indian dishes are chalta hai types.|positive
Rated Food Eaten: 1. Idli Wala( 7/10) - The idli was cold and looked like it was prepared hours before. The wada was big and crispy. 2. Paper Masala Dosa( 9/10)- I give it 9 on the basis of its huge size. I have only seen a few dosas as long as this one. Plus the cost of this one was just INR 87. This is worth every penny. 3. Onion Uttappam (8/10)- The size was bigger than most of the Uttappams served in other places. But I expected the taste to be a tad better. 4. Filter Coffee(7/10)- The biggest letdown was the coffee. Had expected it to be top notch considering this is an Udipi. Needs to improve the taste of coffee. Service : It was quite fast and satisfying.|positive
Rated The waiters were baffled when they heard our order here..Veg Pulao with Paneer Butter Masala. Truth be that we needed something sweet in your dish...the spicy food had already wreaked havoc in our tummies and nothin can be sweeter than pulao and butter masala items. The pulao was delicious...an ample quantity of rice,paneer and veggies: Cooked specifically to match our sweet tooth.The paneer also was cooked to our liking..A special mention to the Butter Chapati...It was simply too good. P.S: 2nd review in Mumbai...Jai Maharashtra .|positive
Rated I have been visiting since my childhood.. During that days it was the only restaurant which was good enough.. It actually stealled the business from near by restaurant .. I am rating these place based on my childhood experiences.. These place is very close to my heart and it will always be|positive
Rated Was on the way to home from work & came across this hotel. I had the mysore masala. Nothing special. Decent taste. Nice amount of masala. Good chutney!!|positive
Rated I had a massive taste explosion after just one bite into this amazing Chicken burger. I think it was a chicken thigh with a gorgeously crunchy exterior and juicy goodness of the meat inside. The burger also had the right amount of lettuce and mayonnaise. To sum it up, I'm coming back for more and I'm surely advertising it to everyone I know!|positive
Rated While in Bhandup for some work, a quick zomato search pointed me in the direction of The spot. The eatery is pretty small and would have been easy to miss had it not been so brightly painted. The spot is basically a cash counter, a soda machine and some place to stand. There is no place to sit, so its best to thought of as an order in or take away place. I ordered the BBQ chicken burger with cheese, the schezwan chicken burger with cheese and French fries. Both the burgers had a good amount of sauce and tasted exactly like they sounded. The chicken was in chunks instead of a patty and was well cooked. The fries weren't super crispy. They have a variety of flavoured sodas, we had kacha aam and kala khata and both tasted great. Overall the spot is a good place to order in or take away from. The food is tasty and its pretty inexpensive.|positive
Rated Great place. Location is an advantage for them. Some delicious burgers with good quality and quantity of stuffing. Can order on call for office parties. Better than McDonald's burgers.|positive
Rated Normally when we say burger this joint does not come to mind....But yesterday when i tasted their burger I really loved it... Located opposite to Huma on the way to station it is always busy...After coming from a morning show was feeling hungry and was not thinking of spending a lot...So I went to this eatery... They had several options both in veg and non-veg...I had ordered Tandoori chicken cheese burger...The chicken was crisp and spicy..... the bun was also soft...some extra cheese could have been added...but overall it was good I will be visiting this place again...Its good for after office snacks....|positive
Rated If someone were to say "Lets eat burgers and zingers" then KFC would be the only place that comes in mind. But The Spot has really earned its name to earn 5 stars. I visited the branch that is just outside Kanjurmarg Station. The locality is always bustling with people travelling to and fro work. And if you happen to feel hungry, then this is the perfect place to be. Not only do you have a wide variety of choice on the menu, but also get served in a matter of mins. And from every time I visit the place, it always serves hot, juicy burgers. (My mouth is actually watering when I'm typing this) This is a perfect place to eat if you are on a strict budget, but if you still wanna taste some burgers, Chicken Strips etc. Kudos to the management. We hope you guys arrive in Kalyan. Soon....|positive
Rated Merry Christmas foodies : So i caught Star wars today and was also craving for Burgers. If you're in Mumbai and sick of eating Pav Bhaji...come to this place. The burgers are just too soft and juicy and tempting. I couldn't stop at 1. Had Chicken Malai and Chicken Schezuwan with Malai dip. The malai dip is a strange sauce made of mayo and other spices..very juicy and very fattening. But hey, its Christmas ; no need to watch those carbs 😊 My personal recommendation.Start with something basic such as Chicken Burger and upgrade it with extra cheese malai or tandoor sauce. This place hits at the right Spot of any foodies burger fantasies..keep up the good service😊|positive
Rated Ordered a barbecue chicken burger. The service was timely and the price decent (Rs. 60). The texture and taste was acceptable. I like the soda dispenser they have. Overall, it's a nice place, though it is recommended to eat early in the day when the patties are fresh.|positive
Rated Its a tiny place for a quick bite. Price is the best for what we are served. Had a chicken burger many a times & still love it. The Bbq chicken burger is also good.|positive
Rated I had the chicken shezwan burger in here. Very very paisa vasool. Mind blowing shezwaan and good chicken. The have delivery options too. Try them|positive
Rated If you want to have decent quality food in Huma mall then this place is for you. Taste is good. Please note that this hotel is not pocket friendly. Parking is available.|positive
Rated Visited this place after office hours with a colleague. The ambience is quite ok, bit like a family dining look. We ordered drinks n chicken kebabs n some veg starters. The kebab was good, but the service was not that great as the staff were not attentive. Prices are a bit high, we ended with cheese nan which was nice.|positive
Rated Huma might be one of the shabbiest mall in the city. It is like walking through ruins. They've got some guts to open up in such a place. 😷 The ambience is the usual fine dine. The food is average. Had ordered the chicken sweet corn soup which was just okay. When browsing through an exhaustive menu, thought about getting some recommendations from the staff. It was a wasted attempt as he couldn't explain anything. The funniest of replies were like.." Sir, chicken and gravy hoga".. " sir, usmein chicken aayega..aisey (he gestured the shape of a cup with his hands)" ...I was like, wow! I asked a tricky question...didn't I? 😜 I went with what I thought would be best and the dragon chicken was served. It was nice, hot and flavourful. The service was good throughout. It was followed by an American chicken chop suey which was too much in quantity and mediocre in taste. A bit expensive considering, you ain't happy right from the time you walked through the shabby ruins and will be walking all the way back through the same after having average food.|positive
Rated Yesterday me and my sister in law were at hill road and we had parked our car at globus parking lot..so when we came back my sister in law so bubbles tea and she wanted to go there..so we decide to check till our car comes back from the valley. Bubbles is a concept of Taiwanese bubbles tea also known as pearl milk tea which was introduced in UK and US and few asian countries has been introduced in Inda by Mr.Adnan Sarkar. The Ambiance is White with small messages written and stickers on the wall along with the menu and picture of Dr.Bubbles Special teas. We ordered for a small Guava with Strawberry tea which had strawberry jelly bits Taste was good..it was not so sweet just perfect.!! Now comes the Cons !! There is nothing like bubbles in the fruit tea..when we asked for it they told has they have different jelly poppers for it and when we asked them to add it..they were charging us 80rs for which I said No. The staff dressed in white needs to be courteous with the customers and their drinks. The lady who was giving the drinks was struggling so hard to put the straw and was very rough. There were stickers on large drinks..my sister in law being a sindhi bahu started asking for one sticker..the staff said Ma'm buy one large drink we will give it to you..she said aise hi de do.Ma'm wahan likha hai please read karo. She was joking with them but the staff guy became so rude with her she said you guys need to get calm and not be so rude. 3.5 is just for the concept and awesome tea other points are deducted for the staff I will visit again for other flavours !!|negative
Rated Mumbai certainly has a shortage of American style diners. Although a tiny café in the bustling Lokhandwala market, Milkshake & Co. partially fills this gap with its tall chilled glasses of shakes. I went there for a tasting which means I got to try mini portions of a lot of these shakes. My favourite of the lot was Oreo Shake and I also quite liked the peanut butter, dark chocolate and coffee flavours. The young chef/founder has worked in Michelin restaurants and some of that influence shows in his double cooked fries. They're even more decadent when smothered in a cheese sauce. bombayfoodie.com|negative
Rated A little over-priced for milkshakes but one can make a visit once in a while. They have a millionaire shake which apparently has a 24 karat gold leaf and is priced for 1500 bucks. In any case, do try the Belgium dark chocolate shake!|negative
Rated Nothing compared to the original boost in Australia. The ingredients might be an issue here but the overall preparation, the proportions, mixture, flavours etc. have that magic missing in them and are not worth the money. We tried the all berry and the berry crush but cudnt make out the difference (both were bland and pathetic). Let's hope they match their standards with their australian counterparts.|negative
Rated Ordinary juice parlour offers way better juices than this place. I tried strawberry smoothie. It was pathetic. Tasted very bad and liquid and pulpy portion can be seen clearly. It was not even close to smoothie. Totally Waste!|negative
Rated A temple for fitness freaks, this place makes and sells purely fruit shakes without adding any external flavors. It is quality at its best, but not at all a place for calorie lovers. We ordered blueberry shake and strawberry cream. However, the blueberry shake and strawberry cream had pure fruits and milk and also cream but all in its absolutely natural form. This place is recommended only for fitness freaks. Taste lovers should avoid it. Taste Quotient: 2.5/5 Ambience: 3/5 Service: 3/5|negative
Rated I was damm tired after the trek and was very much dehydrated because of the scorching heat. Their lassi literally got me out of the fatigue. Amazing taste and filling with malai and butter. They serve half lassi and a variety of other flavours. Will surely try out others too.|negative
Rated This branch is not exactly a place to chill it's better to order - don't forget the chocolate chip cookies - it's not bad at all!!! Otherwise the same standard and beware it's a lil messy while eating!!|negative
Rated Great subs poor service !! Their new rule stating that the minimum amount for home delivery should be ₹200. Refused to deliver a single sub. It's sad to see this place losing its charm over the years �?|negative
Rated I've eaten twice at the versova joint, the food is good but both the times the staff cheated, the first time I didn't notice until I was home, I let it go, thought it was an honest mistake, ordered about two weeks later and again they cheated It's sad that a place with such good food has bad staff bringing the name down All in all, I'm not eating here again.|negative
Rated shawarma outlet and its veg? kidding me. i mean chicken shawarma is not there. hated that veg paneer sharma. I mean how can A so called 'Shawarma King' can open a veg outlet. Worst Worst Worst.|negative
Rated This outlet doesn't have any drinks or sundaes. It only has cookies. They only had two cookies left. It's kinda disappointing because the Lower Parel Outlet it the stark opposite.|negative
Rated The meal combo is a very good option-- filling and affordable. I ordered paneer satay with cheesy potato pops and cold coffee. Pops could have been more cheesy ;-)|negative
Rated Starbucks is right next to express towers just off nariman point. The cafe is really cramped and frankly the coffee is OK. If you stick to the tried and tested coffee drinks, then all is well. But don't fall for the new drink options, most of them are strictly OK.|negative
Rated Recommend- the Belgian Chocolate waffle,blue berry cheese cake... Not that great-peanut butter waffles, But if you waffle lover.. You shouldn't have a problem but if you chocoholic definitely go for Belgian chocolate ...|negative
Rated Okay, maybe i had the wrong thing here. Never ever order for the mix fried noodles. My cravings for chinese just died after having it.|negative
Rated Real cheap. Quality food. Quick service. All what you ask for when you go out to eat. A small place, always crowded. Short on cash, long on appetite..? You've landed at the right place!!|negative
Rated Went to Fenix for their Bengali food festival and was thoroughly disappointed. Started with Fish Kobiraji which in itself was great - low on batter and high on fish. But the Bhetki Paturi was a big disappointment - raw fish in the middle! Totally not acceptable! The Mutton Kosha was unbelievably good but by then we had lost appetite. Hope this is a one off affair and they continue to serve what they do best.|negative
Rated After a evening walk at Nariman point...found this cafe .. It was little wired to see people playing music on loud speaker from phone and iPad in public place .. Cafe must have since restrictions on that part .. We ordered for Momo and coffee .. It was ok ... Service was very slow .. As we could see only staff in entire cafe... Management got to look into same Over all it's ok experience|negative
Rated Didn't expected!! Nothing was tasty at all. The non veg platter was only just 10% good But the main course and the biryani was drastically worst. No taste! Poor service! Spoilt our dinner , Wasted our money!!|negative
Rated A very overrated restaurant . If you got extra moolah to spend and just want to come because someone has told you about it ..pls do . Very boring interiors , staff will treat you like you have come from the third world country , food is very very average . Must : only the teas and coffee and...bread basket Detoxification juices . Price : steep Overall : average|negative
Rated I have been to the nariman point branch several times. U can't compare the bandra branch at all to this. Food standard was below average. No bicottis with my coffee. No fudge with my bill. I love nariman point. Their food is fresh. I asked y so much difference between the 2. I was told they do not have a bakery in bandra hence no cookies or fudge. Can't buy this excuse.|negative
Rated Have been to other outlets of brownie point.. this is amongst the worst. Only the place looks awesome n nothing else was right.. Service was bad.. pastries were so tasteless.. We took one dutch truffle n one swiss truffle.. Both were soo tasteless..a normal slice cake from monginis would have been better.. Only the chocolate chips on the pastry was tasty.. obviously it wasn't made by them.. :p Dunno if all cakes were same o I went wrong with selection.. will never visit this outlet again.|negative
Rated I m shocked on seeing the menu, the brownie list is so big, while when we visisted there were hardly two types One was chocolate fudge N d other being walnut brownies Which both tasted d same Same case with all other 2 branches too juhu n bandra....i hardly gt to see more than 3 types of brownies on shop|negative
Rated Food is not great. Made an online order, they did not send the pav with missal pav, they did not send the rose lassi, made the mistake of paying online too and now it's impossible to contact them as the person who picked up was not aware of the order it seems. Crazy I must say.|negative
Rated Food coma is what will happen....delicious indulging Iip smacking food...the thali was huge...dal fry with the tadka is must have ...the ghee chapatis were soft and after a few you won't be able to move...baigan bharta and palak...were ok...sev tamatar was a disappoint ment ....don't forget to close the meal with an amras..but all in all you can't miss this... The dal tadka is still on my mind...|negative
Rated Staying in western Mumbai, didn't even know this place exists that too near Cater's. Being a weekend was too quite for this place though it's ambiance is dressed as a lounge/pub. The service was ok. Rating it that way as the servers were unable to hear our orders. We ordered for Veg and non-veg platters. Totally disappointed. Both oily platters. O would not mind paying for potato bhajias on road side rather spending a fortune in here. Not very happy with food. The menu is very limited too.so had no option. I found it simply overpriced and not worth spending. Will i go back? You know the answer.|negative
Rated This was my second visit to this small restaurant. Short review of the hits and misses. The burgers were glorious, as expected. However, the jamaican jerk bbq chicken we ordered did not really meet the benchmark. The fries were fine, but the brownie stole the show. This place has easily become one of my favvy.|negative
Rated Total VFM take away place. Thrives on volumes and scales. Low commitment and the owner was not even ready to take feedback on a goof up of an order. This veg place once had a decent reputation. Its the beginning of the decline of this place due to poor attitude else food is acceptable. Dont rely on this place for committed execution. Urge them to listen to customers and manage better. Just reading all the reviews of home delivery experience tells you about their disastrous way of handling. They let you miserably down on home delivery in terms of quality and experience and the rating for that part is just 1. Owner and staff attitude to listening and committing is zero rating. Quality of raw materials is low end and highly suspect. Highly avoidable outlet.|negative
Rated Very rude ppl and the service is extremely poor I am staying just 5mins away from there place and they insist that I order more than one stuff if I order more they have delivery boys if it's just one item sorry no delivery boys available The previous time they made me wait for my order for 2 hours 30mins It's sad and a very poor service place Dnt knw abt eat in there but home deliever very very sad And the staff very rude if u question them they will just keep the phone down|negative
Rated Utter useless customer service, there is a surd on the counter who dsnt know how to treat customers. Usually never rate an outlet 1 but would have given them negative had it been possible. Improve your attitude guys, dsnt take time to fall with bad attitude.|negative
Rated Have been going to Jhama from the time it has been opened in Vashi and have know from the Chembur times. The Gulab Jamuns and Singar mithai are know and are kind of highlights here. Since I'm having Jhama Sweets from my childhood there's a soft corner for this place but also can't deny the fact that things are changing and sadly not for the good the few reasons are 1. Staff is rude and most of the times they tend to ignore you 2. The owners or the manager don't bother even if one expresses the displeasure towards the staff 3. Sadly the taste is also changing This time though had a real hankering for Dahi puri and I was near buy so just dropped by and yes I was satisfied with the taste but the staff was again a real let down|negative
Rated The smell of Samosa, Chole Bhature and Jalebis will definitely draw you closer to this place..Always buzzing with unlimited samosas and Bhature getting fried right in front of you!! Make a call before you go on the day of Hindu festivals as they sometimes skip samosas to keep only sweets on those days!|negative
Rated Very poor quality ... Samosa and kachori were very oily and horrible taste... Don't recommend you trying this place at all no matter it's located just outside the station ... Good location horrible food|negative
Rated I am always up for trying chaat from different places in Bandra. Ordered online and also at around 18:50pm for a Bhelpuri, Sindhi Took and Strawberry Milkshake. The Bhelpuri was average, Sindhi took was also average and the strawberry milkshake had it as didn't want to waste. No clue how is the rating so high, they took 1 hour to deliver, also when I called he said we told Zomato it will take 40min, I just mentioned to him saying I am the customer and you need to inform me not Zomato, ridiculous I think it's to have the audacity to say we informed Zomato. Why put delivery as 30min when you can't deliver in time.|negative
Rated One of the best place where you can get pav bhaji and tava pulav. But place is not hygenic. They create filth all around. The place is also not safe as they pile up gas cylinders next to customers eating place on footpath. Yes the hotel has extended 500% illegally over the footpath and have created a party hall by converting open terrace and creating a staircase through duct lane. We should avoid this joint for these illegal extensions.|negative
Rated Everybody has been raving about their samosas..i had an aversion for them after eating here... skip it..really pathetic. Brij albela is better off serving sweets ..although not the best around.|negative
Rated If your ready to get lost in an ocean of sweetness then Jhama is the place for you. The staff are always in a rush as the place is usually packed or over crowded and during festivals its impossible to get what you want (they usually get out of stock) But there is nothing that replaces Jhama as such from their gulab jamuns to jalebis and moti chur ladoo, everything is just yumm!|negative
Rated Hooka lovers can go there. It is situated on a mountain and hence the view is amazing. They have an open air hooka bar. I accidently went to this place to have food, which they serve but its more of a hooka place than a full fleged restaurant.All smoke and no food makes jack a sick guy !|negative
Rated Totally unhygienic food.. Beware of this hotel.... And owner is with very very bad attitude.. Repeating again Totally unhygienic food.............|negative
Rated Sardar Paaya House is a small, lesser known, rundown, hardcore nonvegetarian establishment located in the bylanes of Sion Koliwada, hidden from the pandemonium that Koliwada happens to be in Guru Tegh Bahadur Nagar. LOCATION: Invisible from the main road, it is located in a small lane next to Hazara Restaurant perpendicular to J.K Bhasin Marg.Inconspicuous that it is, the best way to find out is to ask someone on the street. CROWD: This isnt a place for vegetarians. The only two things in the menu that do not contain meat are pav and Bisleri.Mostly office goers or students frequent here and this isnt a family place. SERVICE:Restaurant is open from 1pm to 5pm.Expect to wait outside for a seat on Sundays. Service is very quick given that the menu has so little on offer. Parking facility is non existent, but you will find space in the by-lanes, no doubt. DINING EXPERIENCE: You might enjoy it if you do not give a damn about hygiene and it is just taste that matters to you.Their Kheema pav was delicious.Menu is limited. 1. Paaya Gravy. 2. Paaya soup.3. Mutton Kheema.4. Chicken gravy.5. Mutton Gravy.6. Paya (Mutton).7. Rice. PRICE: Costing about 100-120 per person for a meal. VERDICT: I realized that paaya isn't something that I relish.Kheema pav however was delicious. Highly recommended. AMBIENCE: 1.5/5 LOCATION: 2/5 TASTE: 3/5 HYGIENE: 2/5 SERVICE: 4/5 OVERALL: 2.5/5|negative
Rated Food quality is bad,not hygienic, place is messy and dirty,plus the food's taste is also not great! A total no for this place is what I'd say!|negative
Rated Service is not good and main thing they don't take care about hygiene.food quality is average.food processing is slow. Ambience is just pathetic|negative
Rated Owner of the place don't know the difference betweek Chicken Tikka and Chicken Tikka Masala. Used to be their genuine customer before as they provided food worth the price (CHINESE). Went to take a delivery as parents were out of the city. 1st day i ordered a chicken tikka masala. The dish they delivered was chicken tikka and not the gravy which is known as chicken tikka masala. Charged me with the price of chicken tikka masala which is high and provided me a chicken tikka which costs less. 2nd day i ordered a full chicken tandoori. Personally went to order and made a complaint of the food which was delivered a day earlier to which the owner said it is impossible. We can never make wrong deliveries. I said ok forget it and just pack a chicken tandoori full. Asked for dry sev and schezwan chutney to which the owner asked "Tumko sharam aata hai kya?" Would have shoved a 100 rupees note up his ass if he could have asked for but insulting a customer who is a frequent eater. Finally gave up on the restaurant. SHITTIEST EXPERIENCE WITH EGOISTIC OWNER!|negative
Rated Though the food is good to come back for but the service is so bad that it almost makes you hesitate to come back at this place. Some special dishes such as Chole Bhatura, Palak Dal, Paneer Tikka Masala are really good.... But then again, the lazy staff, the lack of any attention span, the slow service, etc., makes you to not go there again.|negative
Rated Absolutely average. Good as an option but nothing out of the ordinary. Service is slow and home delivery is much slower. Taste is again average.. Aloo paratha is okay but give the Gobi paratha a miss especially if you do not like Gobi. (I m a cauliflower fan and they managed to put me off it for quite some time). However, if you are in that area, do order or eat there once (especially on a cooler night).|negative
Rated Hospitality might be a saving grace to anyone who serves average food. Add to it the sheer arrogance of the in charge person who plays deaf and indifferent if one wants to report the nature of food.. Since there are very few options in this area I stumbled on this outlet.. I would suggest rather go hungry than through this turmoil...|negative
Rated Very very tasty food...came bombay nd never ate thaker thali food then its useless..this food is seriously yummy...a bst gujju thaali for ppl...if anyone is getting lazy to make food..u jst have to come here nd have tasty home type food..@ thanks to all|negative
Rated Located next to Le 15 so you will be highly confused whr to Go..I decided to go here as i visited le 15 before...I had red velvet cupcake which was yummy better than theobroma and and chocolate cupcake which ws ok ok..Staff lacked communication skills They looked confused on everythng|negative
Rated I feel it was a mistake today. When i entered this cake shop i had alot of desires. I had purchased the mud cake and red velvet pastries. Personally the mud cake made me cry , It was an insult to choclate . The red velvet was way too sweet. Mayb they have alot of sugar and they love putting the excess. I learnt from my mistake wont go ther again.?|negative
Rated Located in the Food court of inorbit, this place is my saviour on the cheat days. When I want to cheat with something really yum, but not very unhealthy. One hummus platter is huge for one person as they give you a hummus with pita along with shawarma/nachos n a cooler for only 250. Have had almost everything off their old menu n love each thing, haven't tried the new additions except the nachos which were great too. navimumbaifoodjunkies.wordpress.com|negative
Rated Again this is a local bar with cheap crowds ... so beware before you step in. The rates of food and drinks suit for local pockets ... they give complimentary papads with drinks ... choose AC section which is a non-smoking section with 6 tables. Food is okay.|negative
Rated 022 26482444 This is a wrong number 022 26482444 This is a wrong number 022 26482444 This is a wrong number 022 26482444 This is a wrong number|negative
Rated The place seems to be running just coz MUMBAI's PARTY hub makes it run.. The cashier seems to rude to talk to and secondly one can barely talk in the sound.. The bartender are the same so as the people at entrance.. And as per the hype and all the club is quiet small.. And can't expect much.. Saturday's are the only days to go I suppose as the crowd covers up the place|negative
Rated Located next to the taj alibii is one nice but small place... The alcohol is is served is a little diluted... The place picks up slowly but is small and gets stuffy but the music system is good nothing that would bother your ears.... could go there once in a while when the entry is by guest list|negative
Rated Shady club with more vip tables and no dance floor or space to stand and order for drink ! Kids are allowed and music is not really up to mark as they play old 90's to house music of 2016 ! Hate the lights / ambience ! Make something beautiful and spend some extra bucks to make area for people to at least stand !|negative
Rated Worst placeeeeeee ...worst crowd....if ur decent enuf u shud nevr b visiting this place..don't gooo service sucks waiters sucks mzusic sucks 5 star price will cheat u...2000 for 4 people 60ml smirnoff vodka and 2 pint beer|negative
Rated A perfect place to get drunk. Alcohol is cheap and music played is too loud. Ambience is amazing. The entire place acts like a stress buster. Most of the times they come up with some shows or competitions to attract the crowd. A new addition to the list of places where you can get drunk without being even a little hard on your pocket.|negative
Rated Bad crowd, really small place and bad food. We had our college farewell here last night which didnt really fare well :P Sums up my Club Escape experience - must escape! thefoodauror.blogspot.com|negative
Rated was here for a private party...But really not the kind of place to be if you are with friends n family...specially girls.. rowdy crowd.. horrible food ... only give 2 rating for the music... music was really good... The most annoying thing was since it was a private party we were ok..but after 10 pm they started allowing regular guests and after complaining the told us only a few special ones would be allowed.. but they took in atleast 50-80 people..which made the whole place horrible!!! Can never even think of hosting party here|negative
Rated Wooaah wat has happened to this place. Once upon a time it was an amazing club which has been ruined to graves now. Please do no visit. Caution warning etc etc etc|negative
Rated Poor place and no manners for the guys at the entrance. I don't think it's a place to visit at all. Too crowded and totally undervalued place.|negative
Rated Umame is one of the better pan Asian restaurants in the city. This restaurant is the baby of Bombay restauranteur Farrokh Khambatta and was the answer to many a Bombay foodies prayer when his iconic Joss restaurant closed down. It has one of the best sushi menus in Bombay after wasabi at the Taj. A few of the dishes I feel are also a natural progression from the menu at Joss which I will mention as this review continues). I would recommend starting with the oriental crab bisque with Chinese parsley. For the vegetarians I would suggest the asparagus and pine nut cappuccino. Both had similar versions on the Joss menu which was a favourite of mine. In appetisers their grilled new potatoes, rock corn tempura, cherry wood BBQ cottage cheese and sautéed mushrooms and waterchestnuts in dried chilli are favourites of mine. I'm non vegetarian options I would recommend the whiskey flambéed prawns, BBQ chicken with cherry wood smoke, the mince lamb on sugarcane skewers and grilled beef on bamboo skewers. For sushi I usually get the dragon rolls and the spider rolls. In mains my favourites are the black cod in hoba leaf, smoked Himalayan trout and the chilli prawns . One of my favourite dishes in Bombay is their pork, shiitake mushroom and spring onion bibimbap. Special mentions for their Balinese clay pot and rice(I usually have that with lamb at joss although not sure if that option is still available) and their prawn khaosuey(also a fave at the Ncpa cafe catered by them). A meal at Umame is incomplete without their signature chocolate cigar with prune and Armagnac ice cream. Also if your in the mood for something a bit theatrical try the "Big Bang theory". A dessert big on presentation not to big on flavours though. My verdict on Umame is that it is definately one of the finest pan Asian restaurants in Bombay. I feel though the ambience is a bit dull with a lack of natural light. A few too many tables cramped in the space. Also a slightly noisy bar so try not to be seated nearby as the constant whizz of blender is quite disturbing.|negative
Rated Visiting it was an experience taking into account the decor, ambience and the feel.... We went for sunday brunch..... Easter dessets.... Too gud.... Gud assortment of cuisines.... The italian and thai food was amazing...But unfortunately some of the food was very cold like the South indian and the north indian dishes.... Vadas and paneer tikka, ice cold... That was a bit of a disappointment .... Otherwise a nice brunch...|negative
Rated I have visited the place 2 times so far. each time as a office outing. The first time could've earned the joint a cosy 3.5/5. But the second time, the food was so horrible that it totally ruined my night. From the starters to the main course to even the ice cream, disappointment after disappointment after disappointment. If it wasnt an official get together i would have left after the starters itself|negative
Rated ~home delivery~ ~buttermilk fried chicken bao~ •tangy •soft baos •crisp fried chicken •cardboard packaging they food was moved Might get soggy if the sauce touches for long|negative
Rated This place came highly recommended so I decided to try it out.. Unfortunately, I must say for a fine dining place this is a total disappointment. After being seated for just 2 minutes, the waiter decided to inform us that we had another 2 mins to place the entire order from starters to main course.. The food is quite average and it's a place for family dining (with cranky kids yelling in the background) #nothappening|negative
Rated The place is good only for the ambience . Over hyped place which charges vaguely and serves the smallest portion possible . First time I have seen a restaurant serving just 3 dimsums per dish. I felt number of people serving were more then number of people having food. Though the quality was ok but the quantity was pathetic. My wife loves Chinese and it was her birthday, but a wrong decision by me to visit this place. Very disappointed.|negative
Rated It's a mini club on Saturdays and Sunday's the people are mad drunk and dance like hell. I visited this place on Saturday by 6:30/7 in the evening and luckily I got the seat after 8 the place is full and long waiting is there the place is happening and the music is way upto the mark|negative
Rated SHORT VERSION - Feel cheated by management and staff! Be careful about the pricing of their suggested items Loud headache inducing music! The playlist was good though. Extremely crowded especially on weekends. Exorbitant service charge (tip) for disgraceful and rubbish service! Food isn't good. Do check out reviews and then order. LONG VERSION - My ramblings - Going to hoppi was just something that happened by chance. I wasn't very impressed with their Lower Parel one hence going to any other outlet wasn't something I had in mind. It's a brightly done up place in whites and pretty vibrant colours but it looks old now! I kinda like the ambience at the place. It's fun and encouraging! The idea of being able to play games while u eat and drink is really appealing. The experience - We started of with a pitcher of kingfisher draught beer which is priced at 275/- for a litre 0.o What a steal I thought but mind you it's not! I was extremely ravenous so quickly ordered for a portion of their cheesy fries and harissan paneer! Ordered for 2 more pitchers thumping myself on the back thinking woot woot I found a place that gives beer at a rubbish rates with great ambience. (Again I should remind u, it's not) We asked for uno cards and Jenga blocks and it was a lot of fun truly. A friend joined us and the pitchers were gone so we tried asking for another and they inform us that they're out of kingfisher and quickly suggest other brands and we settle for bira. 2 pitchers of bira and some more food went down pretty quickly! We were celebrating a bday so we all were in high spirits and called for 3 shots of kamikaze. The food here isn't too expensive either. So at 12.30 when I ask for the bill I'm shocked at a bill showing us ₹5000/- for 3 people. How can this be? 5 pitchers at 275 each and 5 portions of food ranging from 140-300 and 3 shots of 250/- each. Add the normal tax rates one sees and I didn't expect it to be more than 4000/-. It was a birthday night so I decided to not bother and we were all in such good spirits that I let it go, paid and got out! Today morning when I see the bill I feel cheated. Initially I though this place is a 4 star rating but reduced the rating and I'll tell you why - The bira pitchers were priced at 700/- each for a litre! Why wouldn't the wait staff inform us this when we place the order? The previous pitchers cost us 275 so when they suggest something two and a half times the price shouldn't they be informing u or maybe pointing it out on the menu card? We weren't handed a menu card when the suggestions were made. Do they expect the customer to know the prices? Secondly, they levy a 10% service charge. For the uninitiated, a service charge is like a tip! Now this seems very very innocent but when ur base bill is 4000/-, the service charges are 10% of that which means I paid 400/- as service charge. The service is awful. Paying 400/- for that is ridiculous. Does a customer not get a choice on how much they want to tip the wait staff? I feel like stealing a chair from them to make up for them stealing from me last night 😂 Thirdly, the service is shoddy. When the place is empty as it was when we first entered, the service is bad so u can just imagine what happens as the place starts filling up. College kids gyrating on your arm (I kid u not. Imagine u sitting on a chair with your arms by your side minding your own business and someone stands next to you, flips their hair full chikni Chameli style and whacks your face with her hair then proceeds to rub her butt on ur arm! It bothered me a lot. There were tons like her. Also Enough boys grabbing their own crotches and dancing Michael Jackson style) and not one single wait staff around to give u the bill, which u desperately want because of the extremely extremely loud music- they would be better of making this place self service! FOOD AND DRINKS - The food is ok. Harissan panner can be given a miss. The cheesy fries are ok but be sure to ask them to chill on the salt. The four cheese pizza is pretty good and super light, crispy and thin! The nachos are alright and I've had way better stuff so don't bother with those. The jerkin around pizza was by far the best we had at hoppi. Yummy jerk spiced chicken with their fantastic thin crispy pizza base! Droooooollll! If u go there, u must try this! As for the alcohol, it's cheap before taxes and service Charge and post taxes it's alright! There are many places with similar or maybe a little more. WILL I GO BACK? - No, I won't be going back to hoppi for there are better places that don't cheat u and they definitely have better service! If the ambience at this place is ur thing then by all means yes, if not then there are way too many other options. �?�CHEERS|negative
Rated Went here recently when I was near Fun Republic. Their Krazzy hours were going on . Ordered the following 3 Kingfisher beers Veg continental platter Service was too slow n order took fair amout of time to arrive n that too erroneous . Ambience is ok n music is too loud. On the whole an average experience .|negative
Rated if you see my reviews i refrain from writting negative comments unless i have the worst experience...this is regards to the same :-). the DJ is really the worst iv ever come across...he doesnt know how to tune and adjust the controls to the beats..the selection of songs were so poor...he was shifting from english latest to early 2000 yr hindi tracks to suddenly punjabi tunes...this is the worst of worst music iv ever heard...Really a sad place to be at...they have added some tables even at the corrider next to the loo for hookah which spoils the look at the place...earlier this place used to really rock when there was not much crowd,but now the crowd has increased and place has detioriarated (regarding music), even the LOO stinks !! no wonder zomato ratings have dropped to 2.9...if ull provide such dissapointments after charging a bomb...v soon...GAME OVER !|negative
Rated The place used to be good but now the standards have gone so LOW that not even AKON can go there! :P Ambience: 4/5 The ambience is pretty good. Its an open roof top place with a seating capacity of around 60 and its well segregated to maintain privacy yet not secluded. Menu Variety: 4/5 True to a north Indian restaurant, they have a good variety in both vegetarian and non vegetarian dishes. Their cocktails and mocktails are good and not so heavy on pocket. They have a dance floor near dj area and its quiet spacious and has a nice light effect. Service: -2/5 (yes that's a negative 2) I have never come across such lazy, rude, arrogant, and mean staff. They treated us so badly. We repeated our order 5 times. He got starters 1 hour after ordering, and it was cold. Main course again took 45 mins and again cold. They don't have waiters assigned to a specific table. So it was difficult to get attention of a waiter passing by. We were tired of screaming! They heard us calling them, looked our side and simply walked away. One of them looked our side and then looked away and started watching t.v.! I mean what the hell??! This one waiter Vijay needs to be fired! He was the most annoying one. Then their manager came finally (after we called for him for half hour) and served us free coke and said sorry! No! Free coke won't make our mood better. And neither would it overlook the way you guys treated us. Ok so this place is known for hookah. But on our table we hadn't ordered for one. Another horrible experience: A waiter literally blew the coal funes on our table and snickered and left!. He had the audacity to do that!! I have never felt so angry and hurt and #$&%@&#%@&@%# One request: just never visit this place.|negative
Rated menu is exhobirantly priced and the LOO in the lobby stinks like as 3rd class train platform urinal...Being a 5star, such poorly maintained washrooms...really disgusting !|negative
Rated Was there on sunday and this joint rocks yaar. Mojo main majaa aa gaya. Very happening crowd.. Service a bit slow but chalta hai when u r hving funnn and daroo... Lol|negative
Rated The only thing good about this place is the ambience, And the hookah The music is a big big disappointment Service is slow,very average food. 3/5 in all just for the place.|negative
Rated Mojos finally a rooftop in Vashi....marks only for ambience....food was OK...service was just pathetic ....watever we wanted to order was not available...it was a Saturday and Dey did not have Budweiser and kingfisher....nly corona...dat was pathetic...sheesha was OK but a tad expensive....definitely service needs to be taken care off....|negative
Rated Worst food i have ever had. Qunatity i give a big zero to them.only the ambience is good rest everything is waste.#worst food#no words ....................................................|negative
Rated Hoppipola was on my wishlist for a long time, finally gave this place a visit. The ambience is nice and different. A big drawback of this place is the loud music, it is so loud that you can barely speak to the person sitting next to you. The food was really not that good. And because of the loud music it was getting very difficult to order. But overall this place is nice to hang out with your friends.|negative
Rated Fingerlicking! You will eat all those cheese and mayo left in the plate! It is generally very crowded but they somehow manage to serve you quick. Extensive menu, you will find lot of unusual dishes which should be given a try. Cheese panini and cheese chilly toast were satiating. Just that I felt the cheese chilly toast wasn't half cooked , maybe because of number of orders for it! Nonetheless if you want to grab a quick bite do not hesitate to visit this place!|negative
Rated This chota nukkad is a food adda to all KCians & HRites. Located in the vicinity of these colleges & bunch of banks, this place is always over crowded. The unique part of their service is they update their menu with new varieties almost every quarter which is not a peculiar habit with their other peers. I had a veg cheese roll this time. Awesome as always! The blend of spices in the potato stuffing that they use in majority of their menu is where lies their USP. Quick in service & reasonably priced, this place is a necessity for this area secluded with premium restaurants which dig holes in ur pocket! PHD's tip : try all the rolls here.|negative
Rated Worst place ever to order from. We planned on getting something delivered to our office on a weekday. We placed our small order at 12.30 pm and were told that the delivery would happen by 1.20 pm. We kept waiting...finally at 1.30 when we called we were told that the delivery boy has left and that he should be reaching our office in ten minutes. (btw churchgate to vt isnt far away too) 1.40-still there was nobody who came with the order. We finally called up one last time and were rudely told by the employee at wok express that the guy should be reaching in 5 mins. when we asked him to give us the number of the delivery boy, he rudely said that we dont have his number and then hung up the phone. I strongly recommend that no one order from here...its almost 3.15 and we still havent gotten our order... We finally settled for something else but these people here need to be taught a lesson...|negative
Rated So it's Navratri and I'm craving sushi and people think sushi is only fish but I tried Tokyo treat last week and this time I just sneaked into a take away for some sushi after a workout as I was craving it. Ordered for a Cucumber Cream Cheese Sushi which was a portion size of 5 big rolls with some out of the world wasabi which actually cleaned me up of the cold. So I suggest Sushi 3 times a day for 3 days and your ENT will never need a visit again|negative
Rated After all the hype I had to try their Chili ice cream which i must say is a very unique flavour after every bite you feel the heat yet you keep wanting for more as the cold ice cream balances it out. Definitely worth a visit.|negative
Rated Absolutely tired of having burger king, subway and Mad over donuts ?? Go for a quick or lazy bite here.. The Ghotala Keema and pav, lime soda, and Cheese N Chicken sandwich is the best you can have here. I am not certain about the other dishes. Overall this place is based on a parsi style cafe.. Quick service.. Cards are not accepted here.|negative
Rated Mediocre Dying place Ok ok food and ambience Poor service Some how is still around Hopefully we had very less to eat and escaped asap...hahahha|negative
Rated Great service. They help you choose if you are confused. Food was ok. We ordered chicken noodles and fried rice as we were already full. The noodles was good but the fried rice lacked little bit of salt. Otherwise the ambience was good|negative
Rated Feel like pizza and pasta and all things Italian? Don't go here. The service is slow. So so so slow. The food isn't worth the wait and the staff is a little ignorant. Everything would be forgiven really, but the food doesn't make sense, the pizza they serve tastes like those pan pizzas at general bakeries... So much no.|negative
Rated Very very poor with their quality of their packing as well as their food. I was highly disappointed with their service in this branch. I usually ordered from tardeo which was spectacular with their dishes. Each and every one was just amazing but this branch served us totally saltless and tasteless dishes from their pastas to Thai curries every single one lacked the basic ingredient like salt. And the packing was absolutely unacceptable. There was curry everywhere except in this dish itself. There was curry in the delivery bag of the delivery guy, our boxes were stained but when we opened the boxes this is what we found👇no curry whatsoever and this is not the first time we have complained about their packing. And this is the one and only restaurant that I've seen that serves curry pre-mixed with rice.|negative
Rated The staff here are disgustingly cheap. 3 of my collegemates and I had to work on a project together. We decided to sit at MOD. We had all ordered doughnuts and coffees, we were speaking in a low voice and there was no other customers there. In an hour, the staff deliberately increased the volume of the music, increased the draft of the AC, and put cellotapes on the charging sockets to prevent us from charging our laptops. Had we overstayed our welcome, they could have told us, resorting to such tactics is disgusting and petty. Again we had all purchased food and beverages, were there only for a short while and there were no other customers. Yet the resorted to these tactics.|negative
Rated I've had some good and some bad experiences at this place. Sometimes I have eaten decent food here. And sometimes when I've tried a pastry, I've been utterly disappointed. Considering there are so many other cafes around, this is on the cheaper side though it it's quality is questionable.|negative
Rated This is one place I'd really suggest to avoid. Their cakes and pastries are lack lustre, tasteless and at times inedible! Their coffee, juices etc are doable but with the number of options there are in the vicinity this place can be given a miss. thefoodauror.blogspot.com|negative
Rated Everyone loves Subway, and I'm no different. But this time I'm writing to crib about my experience. This specific outlet at Churchgate seems to have gotten everything wrong. When I asked for a fresh bread, the staff (named Amol) rolled his eyes. He practically threw the vegetables on the bread rather than arranging them neatly. And he was super stingy with the sauces!! When I asked him to put some more of a specific sauce I got a very curt reply "Aur kitna dalega? Limited quantity mein hai". Um, excuse me? The very USP of this place is that you can customise your sandwich/ salad with say all or few veggies, combination of meats or more/ less of a sauce, right? Not only do I have a problem with the staff who is obviously not trained, but also with the fact that their AC wasn't working for the longest time! I mean you would NOT want those vegetables and meat looking practically dead due to the heat in your sandwich. I'd rather starve. In fact I remember, they have run out of stock of jalapeños and southwest sauce a couple of times that I went there bang in the middle of the day. Ever heard of supply chain management? All in all, this is the worst managed Subway I've been to, and if the manager is reading this, you must do something about it.|negative
Rated Ordered through Scootsy! Chicken Tandoor Grill & Chicken Nuggets(3pc) Both the items were surprisingly bland & cold. The burger was missing all its spices & nuggets were like elastic rubber of chicken.|negative
Rated Can't get better. Thanks for being my friend on dats i really want to cheat on my diet. Miss the chilli cheezos and I am hoping they will be back soon.|negative
Rated One of the favourites if you're a vegetarian. The cheese nachos here are my favourite. Though they're the same everywhere mostly. I got served onion rings with chaat masala so I'm guessing they have an Indian twist added to the dishes here.|negative
Rated Let me start with the plus points: - Location - Ambience - Decor I went for the breakfast with my friends ordered the regular Gaylord's breakfast with fried egg, bacon, fries, bread toast, butter and jam with coffee. Then a vanilla shake for the settlement. Nothing ordinary, regular food in irregular rates! The food is not bad, is it worth the high prices? Never! You get lot of other places with mouth watering amazing food menus around the corner. Plus the waiter who came first! Very bad customer service, by that individual! That was a first, leaving without providing a tip. The management should get some customer service training to the team.|negative
Rated One of the most oldest and finest eatery at churchgate this eatery has been famous with youngsters due to its close proximity with many colleges situated around its circle. With time the place has been degrading the quality of its food and what i ate here before and what i am being served now has a vast difference (obviously degrading). The veg cheese pizza bun was the best thing they had before but now I couldn't even finish half of it because it was so stale and bad ! Thought if taking one more as a parcel but that also turned out to be a very bad option! Staff being old is accustomed to its regular customers and are not joyful to the new ones. This place had its peak but now i think just as people grow old and start deteriorating this place has reached his old age and is now going down in matters of food and quality!|negative
Rated This is the worst Sufra joint by far. Had come here on Sunday, it was not much waiting yet we had to wait for 30 mins for a chicken shawarma. Also the management didn't care. Food had not much taste to it. They need to work on their time management. Manager didn't bother apologising. Food 2.5 Service 1 Value for money ₹₹|negative
Rated I've been dying to have Arabic again after almost 2 years and ever since then I've only found this place on the Web that serves (close to authentic) Arabic. We tried their giant shawarmas which sadly didn't consist of pita bread and was instead a regular indian roomali roti (if it says Arabic / middle eastern on the front of the shop, then I'm assuming you're going all the way and not mixing and matching things). Wasn't that impressed with the size either. If your gonna charge me 100 extra for a shawarma then I don't want anything that is in the shape of a pencil: I want it big and chunky! ! We tried the hummus with sujouk (sujouk is meant to be spicy slices of sausages: the sad contraption we got on our table was coldish and slightly hard hummus without too much of flavor with 4 small pieces of chicken sausages drizzled with some Indian sauce of some sort. It was definitely not appetising at all. Whatever it was, it was not good and defiantly not worth it). And after all of that, the service was terrible. Only 3 tables were filled with customers out of which 1 of them was done ordering and eating and the other had done ordering. We got our food in breaks. Shawarmas first, 15 minutes later: the fries, 10 minutes after that: cold and tasteless hummus. I'm here to eat things together and not eat a sandwich first and then eat the dip I ordered it for ... lol The chicken shawarma was tasty for sure (no doubt about it) and we tried the lamb shawarma as well. The strange thing is that this had lamb mince rather than pieces. You usually find mince in manakeesh or pides so it was rather strange to find it in a shawarma. I'm only giving high points here (after all the crying and complaining) cause I've been dying for Arabic food for quite a few years and this place is the closest I've found in Mumbai. I might just change my mind in the future and the points may just go lower. But in the meantime, I'd go back for sure so as to fill myself up.|negative
Rated One word - Avoid. Went here for a quick lunch and ended up spending an hour and a half coz the server misheard our order and also took a long time. The service is slow and lacks basic etiquettes. They have seating upstairs, an area that stinks and is left unmanned at all times so that you have to call the waiter from downstairs to get you a napkin. They served our food in dirty plates, no cutlery (coz who needs a fork while eating a roll) and no accompaniments at all. Plus the sexist posters adorning the walls were too taxing to look at. What we ordered: Chicken Shwarma in lebanese pita - 2/5 and who puts cabbage in shwarma?! The mayo tasted on the verge of expiration. Parsi Chicken Salli wrap - Okay. Weird store-bought potato sticks in it. Lebanese chicken salad - Unusually orange and simply pathetic.|negative
Rated No doubt the savouries are tasty & there is no dearth of customers thronging this place & it is a much sought after chaat & sweets shop. But if hygiene, cleanliness & the next day strain on the tummy are criteria under consideration for scoring, K P has to certainly do something more to earn brownie points. i have been a visitor since decades but of late. eating here has become a rarity. In fact, I do not remember the last time I ate here.|negative
Rated Went there to nite. .empty restaurant..There were just the 3 of us till almost 11 pa and then 2 others walked in.. The caprioshka and the whisky smash were fine..The chicken wings...Water chestnut and pumpkin dimsum were good as was the sea food pasta. Ordered the Rocky road dessert. .which was okay. . Good experience but expensive ..|negative
Rated We decided to try this place over the weekend. We went to the rooftop. Not bad. Spacious. Slightly loud. Smokable. There must have been about 15 of us and they got us a table in no time. So that's not bad. They even handled all our loud, drunken and a bit more bullshit we threw towards them. People get drunk and loud. So what. The food was quite good. We ordered a bunch of pizzas, some nice and very different herb crusted mac and cheese, I had a pulled pork burger (which was very different since it had either actual apple or apple compote - super fly!!) We then tried their section which was at the bottom of the building. That was alright. Didn't quite like that place though. But whatever. And in general, I didn't find anything great or fantastic behind the idea for this stock exchange style. If u ask me, it's either the same if not slightly expensive since all Base prices are for 30ml drinks (that's like the amount a mouse would slurp on and still want more).|negative
Rated This is a place which gives you a feel of sitting in a small restaurant in Rome or Milan. However, the nice list ends there, which sadly does not include the food. The foods is bland and boring, the menu looks promising, but fails on execution. If you have to eat here then call for the Spinach ravioli or patato wedges. There is no good desert here. But the worst part here is the staff. For whatever reason they are pissed and waiting for you to leave. For the only place in Colaba to be empty On A Sunday night March increments could not come sooner.|negative
Rated I had heard way too much about this place and its food, probably a reason I ended up visiting recently. While the food tastes good and hygienic, the place comes across as over pricey and congested. I think, it's time they expand|negative
Rated Average taste... Not so friendly staff.... Noisy.... I had a strong craving for Greek cuisine after surfing through Zomato and as per the rating decided to dine here and was highly disappointed below are the reasons..... 1. Place was too noisy as i guess there was a company get together will all men with highly consumed alcohol 2. Had to wait for long just to get the menu 3. Biggest disappointment was that the menu didnt really have that many greek dishes. Since we were famished decided to ordere labanese dish "shawarma" which was good in taste but not that great. Highlight of all was orange mojito and Tzatziki. I would not want to go back.... :(|negative
Rated One of the better italian joints in the city expensive as its a 5 star. Try anything pizza pastas you wont be disappointed can occasionally spot a few celebs.|negative
Rated the place is over hyped.. first its hard to find and is at a very shady street ..second.. there was not even a single customer when i got there which explains a lot.. its not very hygenic.. ice cream is good but too much sugar content.|negative
Rated Umm why am I even writing this review. It doesn't live up to its expectations. You're supposed to feed good pizza's guys. Boring interiors cramped up place, home delivery is the way to go|negative
Rated Never ever ever even dare to order for home delivery from this place because by the time the food comes your hunger will be dead and you would have either killed yourself or eaten something else out of hunger !!! I ordered for two pizzas and it took them more than an hour to deliver it even though the place where we ordered was just 5-7 minutes away from their outlet...even though they took time (not a problem) but the food had become soggy and the pizza had become damn stale !! Never ordering again from here.|negative
Rated Khushiyon Ki Home Delivery !!! Rather than wasting so much money and time plus resources and workforce on such advertising concentrate on the food more !!! The pizzas ordered are of zero satiety value - the corners dry even on the extra cheese and thick crust too !! The base looks like made at home - plus the toppings are so less - scrapes out with the bite and all u are left with is the bread (pav) . The side orders are worthless - yes I am rude !! Plus the delivery is okay and the quality declines day by day !! Also dominos is maybe the best fast food joint in inventing different types of taxes in the bill - so the pizza of 600 climbs to 750-800 in no time at all !!|negative
Rated If you're looking for a place to just fill your stomach, this'll be your haven. The chicken seekh roll had just one piece of the seekh kabab and it was very dry. The chocolate brownie was very hard difficult to chew. If they have to increase their standards as a bakery, the brownie's gotta get a bit soft and the chicken shouldn't be dry. Overall, it's an okayish place and one where you'd go if nothing else is open.|negative
Rated I m a fan of IRANI outlet so while near Sale tax office i decided to go to this place. Offcourse checked on Zomato Menu was quite convincing to have Lunch... The place was as expcted by its outlook. Shabby ambience but quite Clean and hygenic. Have AC and Non AC section i opted for Non AC as wanted to have quick bite n run. Non of them were wearing uniform so very difficult to place an order. After a while a guy with stained shirt came to me for an Order. While entering saw Shwarma Maker so asked for Shwarma ,the waiter said Shwarma ill take time atlest 15 to 20 mins i said okk i ll wait then suddenly he said sorry shwarma is not available. So i decided to order my fav dish Salli Boti... I was surprised to see salli boti in Safron thick gravy. And which Mughlai preparation has mozzarella Cheese in it. When i told the waiter he said hamare pass aise hi jaata hai hum salli nahi dalte. The taste was awful they served Maida Rotis which i hate. Over all very bad and sad experience. It ruined my Lunch.|negative
Rated Whenever I visit this place we order only One thing & that is Prawn Chilly cause I haven't seen many resto who serves this size of prawns.Best place to have prawns. Next time I visit this place I would refrain myself from eating prawns & do the Justices to Chi. also. Food - 4 Ambiance - 3 Service - 3|negative
Rated Was vry hungry and visited today in byculla which is in vry crowded place bhendi bazar.. One point deducted for ambiance otherwise taste was gud..|negative
Rated Hunger pang let us hop in this little outlet as we were around this vicinity. Food and service was ok. Its too pricey with the lilttle quantity they provide. Just 1 visit.|negative
Rated The delivery came in 20 mins . Crispy chicken was not crispy ,nothing great about the taste , chicken was dry. American chicken chopseuy was unbearable,gravy was just sweetened cornflour gravy and the chicken was smelly! The only good thing was chapati,they were soft. Bad experience and waste of money,won't be ordering again from here.|negative
Rated This used to be my go to place. Whenever we (family, friends, just me) were in the mood Mao Chinese was there to satisfy us. It was the quintessential cheap Chinese. But over the years it has got so bad that I will now never even consider ordering from here. We bought a lot of stuff worth 1000 rupees. The soups were salty and goopy. The chicken tasted stale. The rice and the noodles were bone dry and the gravies were so replete with corn flour that everything else was rendered tasteless. Once a childhood haunt, now just a distant memory|negative
Rated The service was poor that I can understand it dint look like a full time restaurant but the pizza was no match they dint taste at all good I use to have pizza at pedder road they were awesome but yesterday I had a shock the pizza was worst I will never eat or advice ill try once pedder road again n see is that smokin joes is gone worst or just this branch@|negative
Rated Visited the place for the 1st time. Wat a disappointment! Had a chicken seekh roll which was of rs 40 in their menu but still he charged me rs. 50 and the reason being "utne ka hi hai , chachiye to lo".|negative
Rated This is a fairly good place for seekh kebabs. The best I've eaten outside of the Mohammad Ali road / Pydhuni and neighbouring streets. So if you haven't been to those or you are too 'posh' to go there then you will be blown away by these kebabs. The other stuff was not really very memorable - chicken Afghani, paya soup and naan; so it wouldn't be a bad idea to give those a miss. Don't forget to get the deep fried paratha with your kebabs and make it into a DIY seekh kebabs wrap with the accompanying mint and green chutney. PS - zero ambience, zero decor and lots of Street noise from outside so this is strictly a dine and dash kind of scene.|negative
Rated Situated at the Byculla Junction, Besides Kut n make saloon, is a shabby place, and sense of Hygiene is extremely poor. You can see roaches around the place and veggies kept open. I doubt the Quality of food though its cheap and value for the price they offer. The schezwan is fiercely red, and makes me wonder of the Quality of Ajino Moto they put in the Chinese Dishes.|negative
Rated Cringe-worthy, dry food, devoid of taste. I ordered from them today and was completely dependent on the server for suggestions as I have not heard of a lot of the sauces they have listed. Went for a medium wok with brown rice and assorted veggies like broccoli,carrot,baby corn, water chestnuts and shitake mushrooms. The protein was soft tofu which they call kine tofu to confuse matters further. The recommended sauce was black pepper sauce which was surprisingly coloured red. The food was dry, tasteless mostly with just the predominant taste of red chillies. The veggies and tofu were very less and cut small to be precise. Waste of Rs.220 and my time. In case u were wondering what happened to my meal, as much as I despise the wastage of food, I threw it in the bin.|negative
Rated This place is not as good as it used be earlier. Surprisingly my favourite doughnut here is the rainbow surprise but it wasn't up to the mark today. This place has become below average sadly. Hope it gets back to how it was earlier!|negative
Rated Cant imagine writing a negative remark for burger king..i mean they made GOOD burgers! But highly disappointed.. Not even close to the best burgers i have had elsewhere Tried chicken tandoori grill burger.. Plain chicken in need of more marinade! The cheese chilly chicken burger was too bland.. No...|negative
Rated If you want an order to be home delivered from this place never do that. They just have one delivery boy and it takes more than two hours to deliver one simple order.|negative
Rated Not as per the expectation. Didnt find the sheesha that great. Though didnt try food and stuffs. Really a bad experience. 1.5 only for the ambience.|negative
Rated And this is an update after 27 days. This place has turned pathetic - seems they cant handle the crowd at all If getting an icecream start taking 15-20 minutes to arrive. So you can guess how much time it would have taken for other orders Simply bad experience for a restaurant I had rated 4.5 earlier This is the replacement of the one located in Juhu Superb ambience And very supportive and educated staff Food is not out of the world but one of the must try ones types Bit expensive|negative
Rated Quick delivery however take too long for answering their call ... Raw chicken required better cleaning as it had visible blood stains|negative
Rated I have never been this disappointed ever by any legendary restaurant before. Well, I can see a lot of people have given awesome points and reviews for this rehstaurant but klet me tell you the truth that this is a average restaurant and its only in the business cause its operating in the city for a very long time, that's it. The Bun Maska you get on footpath is way better than the one you get here. Bun was not up to the mark the way it has been hyped. Well, then we ordered Keema and bread... and that is the only thing which was better, french fries were disappointing and so the Parasi omelette which they said as their specialty. Anyway, we were disappointed to the core, when I was about to get my camera outside for taking the pictures and about to ask the permission, owner was on my head shouting ........so thats again a disaster. Service down.....:( And I am sure owner is less bothered about this review. So, no grudges.....But I am done with Kyani....|negative
Rated Literally the worst bse or lounge I've ever been to! Firstly there's no table available on Saturdays, secondly the waiters n services are super bad! The waiters are rude and take hours to get the drinks or food. Couldn't even take orders properly even when mentioned specifically about the nachos being chicken, they kept asking veg or non veg ! Like seriously? Worst experience ever! Never going back!|negative
Rated I think the place is too hyped! There is nothing very appealing at the place. Tried a litchi flavoured drink on the server's recommendation. It was so average. And the prices are also very steep. All in all I don't want to go there again. Total waste of money|negative
Rated This is the first time I am giving a rating of 1 to any restaurant. The place is a mess. Went there for a Sunday morning breakfast. After paying for the order we waited for 20 min only to be asked by 3 different watiers on what we wanted. We finally had to take a refund and leave the place hungry. The rating is for the place and people. No idea how the food is since we didn't get any!!!!!!|negative
Rated Highly disappointed with the borivali branch although I haven't been to any other outlets..I had samosa, paneer jalebi and tewari thali....the samosa was definitely stale and there was no dought about it. The paneer jalebi was so oily that v didn't feel like eating it...the thali was good as the breads were freshly prepared and the basmati rice also had good flavour but that's about it all the gravity dishes in the thali wer bland and lacked the tast basic spices, probably salt was less that could be the reason but am not sure y. And there was another family eating the same thing beside us and they didn't like it either, they just left it... There was just one thing I liked and that was the mini gulab jamuns I'll give a point for that anyway... But sorry am not going back there again.|negative
Rated Visited the place at 10pm, order paneer sabji, roti, dal rice... No salt in rice, paneer was half burnt and rotis were like rubber.. Waiter were watching TV & in their own world. Sorry to say All Chemburkar's Vaishno Punjab has lost his reputation.|negative
Rated Worst place... Worst crowd.. Some time i dont feel safe because the type of crowd was their.. Location is good... Not well managed by owner.. Waste of money.....|negative
Rated Gosh ! Not one order correct , 5 out of 5 times every order wrong , rice for noodles Thai for masaman, list is never ending , online or other wise , just terrible .|negative
Rated Not up to the mark for its food taste, below par experience, highly priced for a restaurant newly come up with average food quality and taste.|negative
Rated Located just opposite Gloria church and Byculla station, this restaurant remains always crowded. Have been there many times especially in college days as it is very cheap. Kheema pav for breakfast makes your day.|negative

Rated Average. Heard about it longtime ago. Tried the Indian Mughlai delicacy. Chicken tikka. Worst. Dry. Looked like the chicken been there since a week. I was very disappointed. Thus thought to try Chinese I was in a bit hurry so I ordered triple chicken rice. Very ordinary. The omlette over the rice was dry The schezwan gravy was not tasty Chicken again baasi Verdict: please go at your own risk.|negative
Rated A legendary place for Seekh Paratha. That's my favourite on their menu. The place has limited offerings on their menu but it's always crowded. The quality is not that bad either. It may look Shady from outside but the food is actually nice and you will see many families enjoy their meal there.|negative
Rated Still I can't believe that , m writing this reviews for shalimar bhindi bazaar. Had dinner on sunday with some frnz. Crowded on Sunday, waiting is there but not more than 15-20 mins, my suggestion is don't visit on Sunday n holidays, food quality is pathetic. U will get ur order within 2-3 mins, ready food, cold food, even sizzler too. Quality was bad. Sorry but it's very embarrassing. seriously very unhappy with this thing. Only good thing was glass of water. You have to serve good quality food on holidays. Please take care of that.|negative
Rated Crazy place to have a crazy evening! Ambience is perfeect to make this place a party place. Luckily, we went on Saturday night when they had Bollywood DJ night. DJ was epic, each and every person over there was dancing. Coming on food, we ordered Guangdong Chicken, Paneer Teriyaki and Herb Cream Sauce Pasta. Everything was decently presented, tasted good and was reasonable. Drinks are little expensive if you don't go during happy hours. Service is slow because they have very few people in staff.|negative
Rated Chilled out place... Neat ambience and cheap beer also the pizzas served here are deliciously than any other outlets of jugheads... Mashed potatoes and corn cheese are must try side dishes|negative
Rated Finally got a piece of the famed Toto's Garage- and it lived up to all the hype and hoopla about it. A little hole in the wall that oozes character and a certain aura in the dark hours, Toto's is as much about cheap booze and greasy snacks as it is about getting an inner circle view of the idiosyncrasies of a very eclectic bunch of co-guzzlers. Rub shoulders with a motley crew of interesting creatures of the night while you struggle to make yourself heard over the retro music and the grunge of gossip. Exchange pleasantries with genteel staff and smile at a stranger as the night wears on and you step out for a breather. Never elsewhere does the texture of the people of Delhi and Mumbai seem so stark as they do in a place like this.|negative
Rated Toto's Garage .. A small restaurant, I personally found it a little shabby. My husband says this was the best hangout place 7yrs ago. For now i would say its a pocket friendly joint to sit, gossip, have beer. The place of kind of noisy and tables were placed so close that we could listen to the conversation happen on the next table. I thought they should add some cocktails and mocktails to the menu.|negative
Rated it's packed. The well-located Copa, sprawls into three sections... an indoor, outdoor and an alfresco bar zone (wooden swings, et al.). We check out the indoor, air-conditioned space throbbing with DJ music, but prefer to hang around outside. Here, both in the drinks and the food, the unusual is highlighted in the familiar... for instance, in the robustly spiced Panko-crusted Keema Pao, the chicken is spiced with molagapodi and the burger has a Tandoori Paneer with jalapeo stuffing. These com|negative
Rated a sports bar, more than half empty on a saturday night... during IPL... disappointed !! Came a long way to check out this place... will definitely try the food and drinks next time and review again|negative
Rated Although the approach to the restaurant & the location may give you second thoughts but once you're inside it's really good. Some quirky pictures from GOT & Breaking Bad have been put up all over the place. Went here in the eve and it was moderately crowded. Food is really good. Try the very reasonable Bacon Bad Slider & The Chicken Barbeque Pizza. The only place, where football match was shown with commentary.|negative
Rated The food is consistently good here but the servers are quite clueless about what's available. Also, this place is empty at lunchtime on Saturday, which is sad. I ordered a roast lemon chicken salad. No complaints but the ginger ale was yuck! they changed it, though.|negative
Rated SPEND YOUR MONEY AT ANY OTHER PLACE BUT THIS ONE. Moms Tomato Soup hand no broth. It was just tomato puree with balls of chicken in it. Horrible. The Brick Chicken came with the same moms tomato soup poured over a stale and uncooked piece if chicken. The beans a potato are better not spoken about because they were beyond ridiculous. On complaining, there was no apology and the explanation was that since its leg piece, it is that way. So we got to know that a leg piece is supposed to be served stale and uncooked, chewy, rubbery and disgusting. We had no patience to argue and just left. Shut down instead of giving this crap...or just serve desserts instead of charging so much to screw up a lunch/dinner that people plan to enjoy with their friends/family.|negative
Rated The place is a lil difficult to find, since it's inside Bandra's narrow lanes. We ordered a chicken burger, a lamb dish, and coffee. All three were below average in taste. The bun was hard, the lamb slightly undercooked and the coffee was okay-ish. It is quite expensive for the food and service they provide. The ambience is probably the only thing I liked. Very disappointing.|negative
Rated Had called firni sweet dish and it was the worst that I ever had. Not tried their food ..Soo sorry guys that was a worst experience I ever had.|negative
Rated Great Soup & Signature Soggy Pizzas We had started with the excellent Minestrone soup, it was yum. The brochette & pastas were very ordinary and nothing special. Being a large party, we ordered two meter long pizzas with 8 different pizzas among them, not sure which one I got to try but what stood out for me was the soggy crust. These are not your typical pizzas, they are so soggy than can be wrapped up as rolls, it’s still tasty thou, different from your normal crispy pizzas. Try the place keeping this quark in mind. The decor is casual cafe style with a Vespa scooty thrown in as a central piece. We had three kids in our party & they loved playing all around it. The prizes are steep & the food mediocre which is a shame considering its very difficult to go wrong with Italian cooking.|negative
Rated Very disappointed! Leaves so much to be desired. I'm really not sure if I would recommend or return here. Very poor service- gave me a pasta instead of a pizza. Had to wait much longer for my order. When the food actually came, the pizza was just below average, less topping. I did complaint but was too hungry to wait any longer! The mango+coconut drink was excessively sweet- hardly any coconut there! I think I expected too much from this place. The service offered in Gurgaon was much better and exceeded expectations though.|negative
Rated Grossly overcharged for a bottle of water - way above MRP. Unreceptive staff, and manager who refused to acknowledge our complaint. An unfortunate experience.|negative
Rated A creative little place opened at the end of the Bandra reclamation road..The major problem is finding this place..trust me without Google maps u wud totally get lost..The best thing of this place is its theme..as its name suggest playlist pizzeria which hints u to select your own playlist(ingredients for making your own pizza)..However they do have an option of the readymade ones meaning already thought of the toppings sauces etc..They have this concept of small wooden block which is used as plates whereon they serve their food..Its a small place, hence gets crowded too soon..However the waiting period is usually not much since its not a typical bar where ppl order there drinks and than sit for hours..However the negatives of this place is their limited menu..they have very limited salads, mocktails and pastas..however they do compensate with the large varieties of pizza..You surely have to be a great pizza fan to like this place.. Ambience 3.5/5 Cost 4/5 Food 4/5 Service 4/5|negative
Rated It is an Asian restaurant, it's not their fault they just are! I don't like Asian food and I was tricked into going there. So I hated the entire experience. But there was a silver lining, they allow you to bring your own booze! They charge ₹500 a bottle and provide you with the mixers and ice et al! So that was awesome!|negative
Rated The quality of food is getting worse every time I visit. The Sushi is really tasteless as are the starters. Maybe they should focus on quality and not quantity|negative
Rated If u r ay infinity mall.. And want to go light on ur stomach with some south Indian stuff.. This cud be ur choice of destination.. Have been here a couple of times.. And have never been disappointed|negative
Rated There are always murmurs of discontent when I come to review Indian restaurants. How could my hum drum, Italo-English foreign palette have any understanding of the myriads of different regional cuisines in India. I do accept that point resignedly. However I would add that Old English food - I mean the type served in Victorian Britain of the 19th Century - does bear many similarities with Indian cuisine. Unlike Mediterranean cuisine, which uses herbs as the main conduit of flavour, English cuisine of that epoque in much the same way as Indian cuisine today placed a heavy emphasis on spices for flavour. Despite promising beginnings, English cuisine never truly evolved and as such gave way to pan-Mediterranean influences and to uniform blandness in many cases. Analogously, that weak milky English breakfast tea, which pervades nearly every UK household, never transformed into bold, sweet and spicy masala tea that now invigorates the senses and warms the heart in Indian households. Another digression! Back to Khyber. I see an English food critic with the same first name as me had visited the restaurant many years back and had given it a minor thumbsup (warmly reassuringly from a gentlemen who claims to have eaten at every 3* Michelin restaurant in the world) Khyber is, indeed, a wonderfully majestic maze of little rooms, marble floors and dark wooden tables. It's a beautiful setting, one which could only belong in the historical home of South Bombay. However, the food is no match. The starters that arrive are passable, but only in the same way that eating cornflakes for breakfast is a mildly satisfactory experience. The taste was familiar, reminiscent of countless generic Indian restaurants I have frequented. The paneer had an alarmingly red tandoori paste marinade smeared all over it. The corn tikki was a greasy affair, much like delving into a Vada Pav stall's cauldron. And the lassi I washed this all down with was expensive at nearly INR 300 The veg malai tikka - the true test of any potential Punjabi wife I am told - was a standout dish. The sauce was creamy, sweet and perfectly balanced by the slightly bitter cabbage inside the tikki. The black daal was a strange mix of too many lentils and pulses - kidney beans, different black daals etc - and was too thin for my taste. The mixed Sabji was heavy with too much cumin and reminded me of a mixed Sabji I had eaten the other week at Tawa (a horror story to be found on Turner road in Bandra) The other mains courses looked average: a leg of tandoori lamb again smeared in that heinously red tandoori paste and chicken tikka masala. Ultimately the grandeur of the interior overwhelms the average at times careless fare and much like the majority of British cuisine that has failed to redefine itself, the Indian cuisine at Khyber feels tired, worn out and in great need of reinvention.|negative
Rated The delivery guy never has the change. He had taken 20 rupees extra last time and even today when I ordered, he fooled me (and I got fooled) by paying extra 20 rupees again. Frustrated. Never ordering from Taco Bell again. Please send change with your delivery boy so that he does not make extra money. Seriously salute.|negative
Rated I did not enjoy the taste of falafel. Went for a combo pack which included falafel, nachos and mint lime juice.... The falafel was tasteless even the nachos. Mint lime juice was disgusting. Will never try falafel again... Waste of money..|negative
Rated Pathetic service by the staff. Too slow! Had to wait almost 15 mins for a single meal order and that too when the place wasn't crowded that much. Place is huge and the food usual as other joints but the service needs to be improved!|negative
Rated Big place so I never had any issues with it being too crowded although the route is very crowded. It's situated in a mall that's not so happening. Tastes like most kfc joints. Food quality is well maintained.|negative
Rated Went over to order a Chicken Shawarma and saw a cockroach galavanting in the food cabinet. Lost my appetite and informed the server who proceeded to catch it with a tissue. Not eating there ever, neither should you if you want to avoid diseases, shudder to think what goes on in the kitchen.|negative
Rated Yummy waffle . Well there is nothing much in it that can go wrong but their presentation and packing is good. Nutella along with crushed hazelnuts. Deadly combination.|negative
Rated It's a bit overrated. The waffles seem good but they are a bit soggy. Is a bit pricey as compared to other waffle places but okay for a visit.|negative
Rated Don't mind the subs pricing or their taste. What's disappointing is that whenever I've been here, either the toast oven is not working or they run out of olives/ jalapenos/pickles or some veggies smell stale. This is just not acceptable. Attention needed here!!|negative
Rated The veggies were stale I said him to toast he always says the oven is not working and the sauces of my choice wer also not present service is very slow|negative
Rated This was worst Dominos experience....... Cheese burst was without cheese, there was hardly any cheese inside which usually oozes out in other outlets.. May be they were finished with cheese. Sad|negative
Rated Damn! Cinnabons in india finally. Wouldnt say that the taste of these matches upto those you wpuld have outside but well, these are cinnabons �?�. No matter how hard you try to look away, but the aroma of cinnamon will pull you to the counter & make you order your week full quota of calories. Must try is the classic cinnabon, chocobon is something which tastes like donut, the flavour of cinnamon is lacking & chocolate overpowers. Hence Wouldn't recommend this. Would have given a 5 rating but the attitude of the staff gets the pointer down. The staff is rude. They were reluctant to explain a customer about the menu & didn't even help her with the process of choosing what she should be trying first. Such attitude from the staff for the first cinnabon place in mumbai , wouldn't really take it far. navimumbaifoodjunkies.wordpress.com|negative
Rated Rs.164/- for one slice of pizza are you guys kidding me??? I expected a lot from this place but was a big let down:(:(:( Firstly they serve you readymade pizza with very less toppings (I had Peri Peri Paneer) and hardly any traces of cheeze!!!!! Its not at all filling and complete waste of money. Now I am damn sure that Dominos is The Best and complete VFM.|negative
Rated I didn't like their pizzas and garlic bread. The slices are big and quite filling but it lacks in taste...very bland. I won't go there again.|negative
Rated It was sunday and i had Worst experience ever.. Fries basket average... Potato Wedges were not well cooked.. Cheese toast - Less cheese more bread.. Veg tacos were like eating pani puri.. Chicken tikka as hard as rubber.. No taste at all... Few drinks and we paid 3K for this useless food... around 600 rs taxes.. plus the swipe card machine was not working... Not enough staff to handle the sunday crowd.. Literally had to ask 3 times to give an order.. Bombay Blue i guess you should take this seriously... Had been to bombay blue 4 times to different locations but i guess this was the worst experience..|negative
Rated This is my second time in Bombay Blue ( had been to andheri earlier ) and have similar experience - Good food but WORST SERVICE EVER! The menu is quite limited . But have no real complaints regarding the taste - ordered sizzlers , pasta , nachos- all tasty ( yet nothing spectacular ) But the waiter kept forgetting our order (literally! When we asked him after a while , he told he had forgotten to place our order O_O). Had to remind him twice for every dish. The billing took forever . Given that nothing is cheap , and they charge 10% service charge , I am totally disappointed.|negative
Rated Another one on the Phoenix Kurla Food Court and it misses the point of being good. Late in the evening on the weekdays, the place is relatively free despite it the food takes a significantly long time to get delivered. We ordered for a portion of Veg. Momos, Chicken Momos and Veg. Basil Sauce with Veg Fried Rice. The portions took a decent wait time while rice and sauce were served cold. Something which irks you to the core. Now the sauce was expected to spicy which here was bland (looks they confused the orders). Momos were less steamed while the fillings were moderate. No for a second time.|negative
Rated Essence of china as the name suggests its for the chinese lovers like me! Its located in the busy and noisy food court opposite rajdhani restaurant. They serve chinese items. We ordered chicken fried rice and chicken schezwan noodles. At first on seeing we wer upset looking at the quantity. Though the quantity for noodles was better but for rice was too less. But as soon as we started that leds rice seemed to be too much (i think the use of baking soda was too much due to wich spoonful of rice left us with heavy tummy) Coming to the taste its not out of the world neither too bad.. It is okay..|negative
Rated Tried the chicken lollipop and chicken schezwan fried rice today ! They tested wel ! The chicken was well cooked ! But i found it slightly overpriced !|negative
Rated Definitely not a place to recommend... We ordered a veg combo 1. Nothing except rice was enjoyable... Rolls were over fried, noodles were not even at room temperature but were cold. No difference in Manchurian and other gravy. Salad they forgot to serve and i need to ask for it. Took quite long time and people on counter had faces full of confusions. Pricing was good but wasted for me as we did not finished anything apart from rice. Taste: 1.5/5 Service: 2/5 Ambiance 3/5 Value for money: 1/5 Overall: 2/5|negative
Rated As the name suggests - only parathas isn't about ONLY PARATHAS!! The famous food brand has expanded itself to serve various chat items other than it's name. One of the outlets at the food court in infinity mall. So there's nothing to talk about it's ambience, theme and decor. FOOD - 2 stars. A customised double layer paratha with stuffing of paneer, aalu, mutter and mint. Good portion size, served with achar, raita and salad the only thing I want to complain about is taste!! Less of salt and bland in taste. Mushroom paratha - All time favourite mushrooms were ordered in a single layer paratha. Again the same problem with the taste - BLAND! NOTE - Found a strand of hair in it a turn off. The staff replaced it immediately and offered any paratha of my choice as a replacement. Mushroom and onion paratha - With the addition of onion the taste of paratha deteriorated even more making it worse to consume. Mango lassi - average in taste wasn't served chilled either. VERDICT - A disappointing experience!! Although the quality of food and portion size was commendable it lacked big time on taste! As the PARATHAS failed to satiate the place is no Value for money. Ratings - Food and Value for money.|negative
Rated When trying new places you ought to make mistakes in choosing. Mauja was one of them. We ordered paneer tikka roll and singapore noddles. At first I thought it was the taste, but later got to know the paneer was stale. That was a total waste of Rs. 150. The singapore noddles were cold and felt like they were made a day prior. Lesson learnt not to eat at a place where the average ratings are below 4.|negative
Rated There can be surprises in the strangest of places. What does one expect in Vile Parle East - the lackluster sibling of Vile Parle West? The area has no famous landmark to its name other than being somewhat close to the airport. Well, I may have just discovered a potential landmark mateys. The place maybe small but move aside Dominoes, Pizza Hut, Smokin Joes and Garcia - Here comes Pizza Box. ... Read full post on grubzone.blogspot.com|negative
Rated Quick service and good food. Few restaurants can manage both . Veggie salt n pepper was deep fried veggies in corn batter. Huge quantity of veg fried rice. Slightly dry and cold when it reached. So they may hv kept it prepared for quick delivery. Paneer with basil gravy was ok.|negative
Rated One of the many Pandas in Andheri.. This one surely has been a great combination of value for money good food with unmatched quantities. I have eaten couple of times at the older outlet (7 bungalows) and also ordered when the requirement was for a larger gathering. Their momos, panda rice, thai curry, burnt garlic gravy, black bean sauce, pot rice never failed to please. Desi likeable preparations of Asian cuisine meant for people who like their food full of flavor and spice. However, I happened to order from the new outlet last weekend and was in for a big disappointment. The burnt chicken starter had zero flavor.. Chicken chilli basil sauce was the worse iv ever tasted.. Seemed like someone added lots of water after the sauce was cooked. And the noodles bland. Overall it was a bad bad experience. I'm not sure if the chef changed along with the location or if it was a just bad day. I'm still not giving up (primarily coz of my previous experiences).. But the Panda henceforth will have to deliver..|negative
Rated UGHHH Never go in there thinking because they are good at most stuff, they ought to be good at all... Had a Nighmarish experience with the Chocolate Pancake ordered. It smelled funny, it tasted something that had gone spoilt, the ice-cream that we ordered as an added topping was a killjoy, worst Vanilla ice cream ever tasted. If that wasn't punishment enough, the so called "pancake" had granules of sugar standing out & tasted like what Gordon Ramsay must spit. I contemplated if I can make myself suffer to a second bite of the brown leathery textured sadness but I just couldn't. So I left it at that. To the restaurant peeps, please & I say please just put on the menu thing you CAN COOK & not what YOU THINK YOU CAN COOK. It would have been perfectly alright if we returned back home on an empty stomach than to have gone through the sad odyssey served to us that no way classifies as a Dessert. By serving your customers what you are clearly not good at, you are creating unfavorable critics & not loyalists. Nobody should have to pay for the food that is not even eligible as edible. Please get better soon.|negative
Rated This place is located very close to my college. Used to visit during class breaks for quick bites. South indian section is good. The place you will find is always crowded as Sion railway station is also very close|negative
Rated A nice place to have meals. I had veg biriyani thali here which was tasty. Beware because this place is always crowded on peak hours. Two bad things about this place is that they have slow service and in rush hours, the restaurant becomes conjusted and sometimes you are sitting comfortably but you cannot eat comfortabley.|negative
Rated Poor food. Poor service. Poor ambience. Recently myself and my friend were going out somewhere so in the urgency we decided to go to this place. We ordered Half chicken tandoori biriyani and half chicken tikka biriyani as he said full would be a lot for a single person. When the order came he got us full biriyani and when we complained about this, instead of changing the food, he was stubbornly arguing with us. And after long bicker, he changed the food and brought us few spoons of rice(literally few spoons) and a single piece of chicken (about an inch). The full plate of biriyani was having a big heap of rice. I would never go to this place again. This is the second time I have been treated like this by raju kabab. The first time, it was something related to food delivery, where the food was cold and tasteless. Basically 1. Food - 5/10 2. Ambience - 3/10 3. Service- 0/10 (I would like to give my rating in negative)|negative
Rated Worst among 3 outlets. Had gone there twice and ordered one. Always been disappointed with the taste. Their Burnt Garlic Rice is a normal fried rice with just some garlic in it. Not burnt neither fried. Even place doesn't look hygienic at all.|negative
Rated Firstly, Dominos is very misleading with its advertisements. This stands true atleast in India. I've had Dominos in Melbourne and the one in India comes nowhere close to it. It needs to up its standard, both quality-wise and ambience/service-wise. I've had bad experiences in the past regarding the service; also in case of home delivery, the pizza toppings do not seem as 'fresh' and 'premium' as they say on the box. The Choco Lava cake is the only good stuff they offer, but in the Versova branch, even that wasn't upto the mark. 1 star for the Choco Lava cake and 1 for its within-30-minutes delivery.|negative
Rated Already at a very bad location and on top of that the place does not have an AC section we had to sit on the outside after we just came out of the scorching heat. On top of that we ordered for a take away and even that wasnt provided with oregano and the regular add ons the staff seems to be lost. The pizzas are the only saviours out here Ambience: 1/5 Food: 3/5 Service: 0.5/5|negative
Rated Visited this place after reading reviews on Zomato, was disappointed. Thought to kick start by ordering Aloo Paratha..the preparation had no salt..when told them about this, they offered some dal..May be a bad day for me !|negative
Rated Over hyped place on Zomato. Had ordered Dinner for two from them today at 8pm through Zomato. Got messages on the app and sms confirmation that the order was placed successfully and would be delivered by 8.53. Their delivery guy landed at our doorstep at 8.52. I was on a phone call and took the parcel and paid up ₹830. They charge for packaging ₹50. To our horror when we opened the plastic bag we found that the chutney zip bag had leaked all over the boxes. If I had noticed this I would have not accepted the delivery. Now since it was already dinner time we decided to go ahead. We found a small plastic bowl with the main curry Dum ka Murg which we found a bit lesser qty than desired. Next we found the foil box containing the Murg Angara Kabab (ice cold) with six pieces. And another foil box holding the Murg Dum Biryani the qty was sufficient. The packaging cost charged is unnecessary due to inferior quality of packs mainly the foil packs which were getting out of shape while only holding them and taking it out of the plastic bag. We had ordered for two Roomali Rotis but were instead served two normal homemade tasteless Chapatis. Totally unacceptable. Now coming to the overall taste, the food is very ordinary in fact most dishes lack the masalas and spices needed. The pieces of chicken can be better and the rice used can also be improved on.|negative
Rated This place is famous for their signature waffles and we too decided to indulge in some delightful sin. The decor and ambience is very sober yet welcoming and we were famished by the aroma of the coffee and waffles. However the service is tad slow. Coming to their waffles, we ordered Chocolate Explosion Waffle which was every bit dipped in chocolate served with whipped cream and ice cream. We were far from satiated and contented with our order. The prices are slightly on the higher end but fully justified with the taste. Would love to try their other waffles and dishes on the menu in our next visit.|negative
Rated The Janata bar of andheri. Don't let the exterior fool you. You can have cheap alcohol and smoke in the account. Don't expect too much... Sasta sundar tikau|negative
Rated If you are really tired after office and need a drink or two in peace - this is the place to be. If you keep going here you will notice that the people coming here everyday are almost the same. Cheap drinks, cheap food, dim lighting, smoky rooms along with a old crt TV are the things that define the place. This is the place where great conversations, stories and businesses start.|negative
Rated We have always loved their shawarmas but such low rating because of very bad experience at this outlet, not once but twice. We went here to grab Chicken Shawarma, but eventually tried Veg Falafel open & classic chicken shawarma. Veg Falafel open has falafel, garlic sauce, pita bread, lettuce & pickle. First, the way it was presented was shocking! Don't go by pictures, it's just opposite of that, dry pita bread, stale lettuce (brown spots on it), garlic sauce & pickle are Ok. With so many outlets around the city, it's a shame to taste something like this. Chicken shawarma was average, they have reduced the amount of chicken and it lacks that juicy Flavor it used to have earlier. We ignored it this time, assuming it's one of those days. Went here after two weeks or so for Classic Chicken Shawarma, and amazingly, the pita bread wrapped around, was hard, stale, and the chicken was so dry, without any Flavor, just a little bit of mayonnaise & hummus on the top. Somehow managed to finish the shawarma, we had a very bad stomach ache; this is just not acceptable. It's a shame on a brand, let alone live up to expectation, they have let down their customers!! We couldn't complain about the quality of shawarma as we did a take away. Certainly not recommending their food, at least the food should not make one sick. Hope they can do something about this! Food- 1/5 Service- 1.5/5 Quality & quality - 1/5|negative
Rated It takes more than 10 minutes to know that your order will take more 5 minutes. It was a tough time for me to differentiate between the popcorn and the strips I ordered. Had tried MFC 2 years ago@ Mira road.. They were initially at par with KFC but now they are way toooooooo far. Poor service/Bad taste/They reuse the same oil again and again/ A definite yes if you wanna treat your enemy.....|negative
Rated Crazy cold coffee, chocolate cookie, hazelnut ice latte, frappe and much more the list is never ending and so the taste and aroma. Located quite close to my house it's good to chill with your friends.|negative
Rated Very slow service. No proper sitting arrangements , and smells bad due to the poultry besides it. Now for the food , it's just average compared to the price point they are offering , nothing special about it I ordered potato wedges and paneer makni pizza|negative
Rated worst service ever. we were seated on terrace section of the restaurant. we ordered sheesha,chilly chicken starter,roasted papad,chicken tikka masala gravy ,dal makhani and couple of breads. firstly waiter forgets to place our order. another waiter comes and ask what our order is. waiter who had taken the order is rude and shows no apology and infact argues with us. food arrives first and sheesha comes later. best part they forget to serve dal makhani with food. completely pathethic service and very average food which is over priced.|negative
Rated Went with high hopes of getting pure south indian food - break fast. But it turned out disappointed choice. As it was sunday as usual rush was there. So server was busy. Ordered Idli, Butter Idli, Upma, Firni, Sada dosa. Rava sada. Mysore sada dosa, vada, Lemon Drink, Filter coffee. Only Idli were little hot, all other food was cold, asked server at last to take back dosa, only one was re served but that too again cold. May be due to rush & also sitting upstairs was the reason. Management needs to think seriously & immediately for such type of service.|negative
Rated I have loved the kebabs here all the time. they just melt in the mouth. Also the famous Raan rice or the Raan chilly is to die for. I just simply love it... only last time i ordered for a Persian special chicken Biryani was very bad. no taste at all... no masala and very oily, was too depressed at that biryani may be its not a dish people order here...|negative
Rated The ambience is better then the byculla outlet. In the heart of bandra. It was engagement party of a friend. We ordered: - Morroccon Kababs - Mix Tikka Platter - Honeymoon Special dessert P. S. - don't miss any from the above list, you will be feeling guilty for life.|negative
Rated I search zomato for writing a review on Moni's and the biggest surprise is the rating! 3.8, seriously for a place as pathetic as this? Is it the nostalgia associated with it or have they paid the reveivers for better ratings? Thane definitely has restaurants which are much much better than this place for them to give a rating of this calibre One visit for a party and this place made sure it disappointed on most of the aspects. An empty restaurant and people do take time to come for the party but the waiters don't even bother to serve water unless asked explicitly. And after the table was full, water was the only thing was was served quickly! The captains are not able to suggest any decent starter unless we ask them about every single type for which they have the same reply. So we went for sholay kebab and banjara kebab and this was the smallest overpriced kebab I have ever had in a casual restaurant. 8 servings for 8 people and the kebabs were as small as they can get. The size of Sholay kebabs was hidden by serving them in a continuous layer half of which was occupied by the masala! This was the beginning of disappointments. Only mint chutney served with kebabs and an extra serving of a small bowl of schzewan chutney costs 40 bucks! This is pure loot. Cheeselings served in a bowl as small as the small ashtray for 25 and we expected a small plate at the least. Going back to starters, the kebabs' taste didn't even compensate for the quantity and even the vegetarian starter was so dry it will spoil your taste buds. We again made the mistake of taking the captain's recommendation for the gravies and it turned out that both the gravies hardly had any noticeable difference between them. The chicken pieces were like the ones used in soups and if this is what they serve when asked for a thick gravy, something is wrong. The only good part of the dinner were the butter nans which turned out to be eye watering expensive. Perhaps this is the only place which serves nans before the gravies for them to become cold! The decently priced mousse were our choice fof desserts and luckily there wasn't enough stock left to serve a group of 12. Yes I did mention luckily since I am sure that they are selling out sourced desserts for a big premium and going by their pricing, I can guess the serving size of the mousse that costs 40 bucks which the captain desperately wanted us to order 9 servings they had. Without the soups, rice and desserts, drinks or soft drinks our bill exceeded 3900. And knowing the usua pricing in similar restaurants, we expected it to be in the range of 2.5-3K and this was the biggest shock of the night. First and last visit to this place even when I am tempted by the chinese starters since I won't ever eat at a place where the humble fried rice costs 250 bucks for the normal ambience. Thanks Moni's for spoiling the birthday party night. Rinkesh Gokulchandani Hitesh Duseja|negative
Rated One of my all time favourite restaurants in Thane. Have been here plenty of times with my friends, family, girlfriend (now wife 😉) and Monis has never failed to disappoint . Chicken Shashlik sizzler is the patented dish that is a must have. They have great choices of various cuisines in both veg and non veg options. Only thing to look at is that it's mostly full on the weekend. Parking is an issue so your car may become a liability.|negative
Rated Taste not upto the mark didn't like it at all and the pav bhaji was also served cold worst experience people come from far places and they are not satisfied people who have extra money can waste here|negative
Rated Tried the tandoori roti and chicken afghani.. Terrible food.. Huge chunks of partially boiled chicken added in the gravy and served. Tandoori roti was decent. The service is as bad as the food.. They don't care even if you tell them that the chicken is not cooked. I struggled to gulp a chunk of chicken but it refused to go down my throat. 3 glasses of water helped. Not recommended at all.|negative
Rated This place has some excellent food and beverages. The only thing that disappointed me here was the services. They took more than half hour to give us the pastas. The services are quite slow. The food on the other hand was mama Mia. The crowd here speaks volumes about the taste. Beautiful place to chill for the noon.|negative
Rated Veryy bad place....not worth going ever...The staff here which consists of two people and that also on a Saturday was very unfriendly. Food was pathetic...we ordered pasta which had brown sauce ( I wonder how you make that)..it tasted like some horrible vegetable gravy...we ordered shakes which were also below average...There is nothing good about the place..highly disappointed :(|negative
Rated Argh....and the people have the nerve to call this a pasta joint. A pasta plate which completely has the wrong sauces & the ingredients. The dude from bihar making the pasta does not know what it is. The people standing & having it dont know exactly what they are having. CALAMITOUS. The pasta with the pink sauce was flooded (to put it mildly) with cheese, cheese & nothing else but cheese. It was a challenge to locate any pasta in there. The dish tasted like a cheesed up rice dish desperately lacking an flavors. It is true that cheese shall be added to the pasta but everything shall be used in proportion & not in desperation the way these guys use. To make it worse these folks stand outside & have a lip smacking meal thinking they are having pasta. Dumb a** mumbaikars.|negative
Rated I am a huge fan of street food and roadside eateries and came here with a lot of expectations. We found it to be very crowded and the staff were hardly able to manage the pressure, which is not surprising. However, the dishes that we tried did not live up to the hype. Probably we ordered the wrong items. The red sauce was way too sour which completely killed the goodness of the cheese and cream. The dishes come in large portions and are quite filling.|negative
Rated Tried Pack-A-Pav at the Bombay fusion food setup at the Style Cracker Borough this weekend! Tried them and I landed up eating all my meals from this stall! The staff was really courteous. Called for the chicken herb pav! The hung curd, their garlic dip and fried onions with their succulent chicken sheekh made it a power meal. Throughly enjoyed it and I'm definitely going to their Bandra outlet to get some more ✌�?��?|negative
Rated This is simple yet full of flavor. Tastes very good !! The herb chicken seekh pav �?� Juicy chicken seekh with hung curd , chutneys and fried onions and ofcourse the buttered pav!! Served with fryums.|negative
Rated Hi Pack @ Pav, Tried to locate you guys on given address, was impossible to find this place, please update your location with landmark. Pack@Pav fan😊|negative
Rated One of the very few vegetarian places where I love to visit again and again. Don't need a reason to be here. I was wondering that how come I missed reviewing this one. You'll be sitting on plastic chairs on the side of the streets and enjoying delicacies with a taste of their own. Cheesy nachos, pastas, pahadi pizza, sandwiches, sizzlers and the shakes and juices. you'll love it all. A must visit to have a different experience. #beware: long waiting time is a common problem for all. Service: 4.5/5 Food: 4.5/5|negative
Rated Never understood the reason why this place is so crowded. The dishes taste absolutely disgusting. The manager is rude to the core. Other roadside stalls besides this place are way better.|negative
Rated Went recently to celebrate a friends surprise birthday party. What a disappointment it turned out to be. Had it not been for very helpful servers, it would have been almost zero rating. I may sound very critical but the experiences were getting bad to worse. First the layout. I feel just to cramped for a up market restaurant, except for few left side along the wall setting, rest were so cramped that one would have to be extra careful to weave across to the buffet. We started at chat counter. Panny Puri has extra salty water and extra sweet chutney. So one ended with strong appetite killer. The chat's too ended being too salty. We thought maybe it was a fault at chat counter, but no the extra salt bit was there in most of the dishes (vegetarian) that we tried. Only things with reasonable salt were Soup and Pasta. Had to survive only on those. Desserts were quite below standard. Cutlery was not looking clean, had dried water marks over them. Airconditioning was lacking big time, it was more sweaty inside than outdoors and it was too stuffy too. Overall, people working there were excellent, but infrastructure lacked big time. I won't be going there again.|negative
Rated Went here with a friend. Had quite an average experience. Their brewed beer was very ok, if brewery is what one is looking for then I'd suggest Doolally any day which is right around the corner. It was a ladies night when we went and while initially we were told the deal was one shot free on a coupon, and a one plus one on any alcoholic beverage, it was much after we had ordered that a senior staff person came and told us the deal was strictly on a wine glass. The food is strictly average and nothing to die for. Finally, the check too came with an extra billing which really put me off. All in all not a terrible experience but most definitely no seconds for me on this one.|negative
Rated Spacious place good interior however very poor quality beer which was a major disappointment, their apple cider was the worse beer served compared Dulali located close-by.|negative
Rated Yuck, Yuck, Yuck😨😨😨 Strictly No No I mean this is a truck driver joint. The cook scratches his head and then makes the dough with his hands. I mean roadside wadawalas have better hygiene levels. The waiters are dirty. You can sit in AC cabins but the food is prepared by dirty hands.|negative
Rated I have been ordering from UTBT since a few years now. This had by far been my worst experience. We ordered for a home delivery of butter garlic pizza, Utbt special garlic bread and stuffed ravioli with paprika sauce. The only think that was OK was the garlic bread. The pizza wasn't thin crust as it used to be, it was super chewy (not properly baked, I guess) and there was no taste of garlic in it ! The ravioli was so bland and tasteless. Really really disappointed. Definitely never ordering from here again.|negative
Rated Had gone here a while back. Somehow I found this place to be average. The food was also ok... the paneer lifafa. Dabeli bruschetta. Several puri tacos. Paneer chilly... nothing really to write home about. The staff was quite clueless and very hurried. Place was noisy and tables were way too close to each other.|negative
Rated Went for a family dinner there... The food was very OK u get better food at Peshawari and spice club... Peshawari type of food is what they were trying to replicate but have miserably failed.... The major flaws 1) there was a fly in the soup which is absolutely disgusting... Not only that the table where we were sitting there were quite a few small flies hovering around... They should invest in a good pest control system to sustain in the food business that is basics... 2) 3 family members fell sick the next day either with an upset stomach or vomiting... Obviously it's a case of food poisoning.... Again no basic hygiene maintained... The stewards try so hard to talk in English... It's a not a requirement to speak in English it's OK to talk in the national language...I haven't rated any restaurant so low but seriously yourl need to improve|negative
Rated Heard a lot about this place finally tried veg burger.. Complete disaster.. The bread very very hard could hardly chew it.. The panner filling was also ok not that great.. Compared to the quality pricing is also on the higher side.|negative
Rated I first tried California pizza kitchen in Ohio around 3 years back and tried again couple of days back. I ordered chicken fajita. The best part of pizza was the sour cream. People in India don't know the combination of sour cream + pizza I was glad that CPK understood :-) Sorry no pics|negative
Rated It's a cafe in Malad in mindspace behind infinity 2 a gud place for gossip ambience is really gud....my personal fav drink is ferrero rocher n after that bronze frost both r different from each other ferrero rocher is little sweet n bronze frost is little dark both r gud at there own place|negative
Rated Over priced is what comes to my mind first when I sit to write this review. The portion size might be huge but you can't eat such a big sizzler. Becomes a bit monotonous too. The service is okay and it's on the roadside so somehow I felt there was too much sound each time someone walked in or out. I would suggest going only if you are really very hungry and can gobble down a big sizzler.|negative
Rated We had received a flyer about the ice cream in the news paper and went overboard in ordering 4 tubs of three different favors . .... Thai., rose almond and sitaphal. The whole process of ordering and the quality of the Icecream left a distaste in our mouth. The hyped hand churned Icecream was powdery and synthetic tasting and passed their prime. .... there was also no manufacturing date and expiry date on the pack .When I called up to convey the feedback on the same number I was told that it will be conveyed to the office . And that was it . No apologies , no make good . A rip off for Rs 300 and 350 for 500 ml tubs|negative
Rated After having dinner at cream centre,for desert we headed to sukh sagar for strawberry with cream. To be honest it wasnt what I expected it to be probably never gonna have it again. Disappointed but shall come for more|negative
Rated It's always crowded, too noisy, Staff does not care, very uptight staff and service very slow Prices are very steep. Personally I would not recommend this place, nothing exclusive about this place. The attitude of staff and services needs to changes for the good. Hope the management reads this and does the needful|negative
Rated Small place.. but gud food... tasty limited dishes.... stomach filling portions... quantity is superb.. all in all gr8 veg n jain chinese.. try it out once....|negative
Rated Great expensive ice cream. They let people taste each and every flavor. Had Chocolate to Die For with Goldmine. Both taste different of course. Eat both flavors together when hard, taste bittersweet. But mixed (blended) liquid state tastes awesome.|negative
Rated Ohh! What can I say about this place? The ice Cream over here left me speechless. I had gone over here a long time back but yet I remember what we had called for. 1) Litchi 2) Swiss chocolate 3) Chocolate to die for. All 3 were just amazing. It was a bit expensive and the prices were not mentioned but the taste covers for all the loss. It is OK to spend more on amazing ice cream. I never knew cream centre had a ice cream parlour brand, we just walked in there as we wanted something cold to eat. Turns out the ice cream was fabulous.|negative
Rated We went to this place seeing the 4.4 review points but was really disappointed with the total experience. Being a Sunday we were, as expected, made to wait for 30 minutes, which was not bad being a Sunday afternoon. The food was a disappointment, with the parathas being friend with oil dripping. The gobhi paratha had more onion than gobhi and the paneer parathas was oily and tasteless. The mawa muttar was Infact paneer matar and there was no trace of any mawa. The saving grace was the Kheer & Aamras which was good . This is small place with cheap pricing and suit the students but not for families who want to enjoy good food. I would rather avoid this in the future.|negative
Rated Worst service ever!! After an hour of placing a telephonic order the ***** people tell that "We are sorry, we dont deliver at this particular location".. The person on the counter is complete dumb and insane, neither noting the contact no. properly nor knowing whether the order gets delivered to the location noted. Do not place telephonic order to such deaf people.|negative
Rated Had been long wanted to try frozen yogurt here & to say I was disappointed was understatement. The small place feels cramped & the AC too was not working. Small size was not available. Tried the Mango & Chocolate flavors with extra toppings. The yogurt taste stale & kind of curdled. Really horrible. Would never recommend.|negative
Rated Probably one of the worst places ever. I just went in to check the place out. I asked for a blueberry yogurt but I instead got a strawberry one due to their carelessness. According to the quantity, I thought that it's a bit expensive. The texture of the yogurt was also not good. The staff was very rude at speech. Not planning to visit there again.|negative
Rated Ordered a millionaire brownie and a loaf of mawa cake this week. Really bad quality of both. The millionaire brownie had a kilo of extra sugar and tasted horrible. The mawa cake was under-cooked and tasted of ghee throughout. Extreme disappointment with a place that has been a favourite for a long time now.|negative
Rated Annoyed! Doesn't live up to the Peddar road and colaba outlet standards. Had a chocolate overload brownie (my regular). It was pathetic, very hard in one corner even after heating it. I'd stick to the Peddar road branch|negative
Rated This is right besides the Wilson College at chowpatty. This Starbucks outlet is bigger than the other ones. The staff is a bit on the deaf side and don't do what we ask them to. The people here talk way too much and there's a major major lack of the coffee smell! The smell which always makes me want to go to the coffee shops is missing here. It's an alright place for a late night coffee run.|negative
Rated The name is big,but this outlet is worst place I have been at Amar juice centre in mumbai Parle,Andheri,thane is good Chowpatty is worst,the server put his finger in water before serving you The food quality is not good,pls avoid this place strictly|negative
Rated These chains have gone quite far downhill from what they used to be. 3 types of chicken sizzlers all tasted below mediocre and i would not plan to experiment here again.|negative
Rated If there was 0 or -5 scoring I think I would give this to you. Sat night. Restaurant less than half empty. The staff was clueless about describing the menu. Not their fault. Bad training I guess. Mosquitos in the restaurant. I'm scared to think how this kitchen must be. I've never had such a bad experience with food. The kids burger n hot dog was below average. Something has gone very wrong with this place.|negative
Rated Decided to try a different cuisine for dinner and came across this mexican cuisine place on zomato. Tried Grilled Fish Panini and Chipotle Rice Bowl and was not disappointed. Quality food and service.|negative
Rated Omg! Called this place for home delivery...and so called Mexican place has no tortillas or tacos!!! Apparently. So I order the THC burger based on these raving reviews which are so over the top like it's paid for or some dear freind writing. SAD. This burger was nothing but chilly in my mouth. No sourcream. Scanty lettuce. Like this is the worst meal I've had in years no...not years...ages. Are people on drugs liking this crap or what? Realised cannot count on these dumb Zomato shit ratings. I was anyways leary eating a Mexican burger...urrrhhh ye...doesn't match on a bun hombre! You not creating any gourmet here puhleeeze. The chicken was grilled well but the burger and bun absolutely no go with the awful chili sauce...u can't taste anything but chili. Bandra you are thoroughly deprived of good food. Now if this came in a tortilla it would be something else... I call and the guy on the phone says no we don't serve tortillas or tacos... Is this a...like a Mexican place or even with some grace Yes me....? Or some Indo-Mexico bakwaas...? Please I mean this population of Mumbai may sustain these guys for a bit. Definitely not real Mexican nor tex mex and people who think it is, need to get a reality check ...or actually visit Mexico or rather even California. GEEZ. Never ordering from here again. I'm so sorry this is so much of a wanna be place. It's popular because it's cheap. I get that. But guys get tortillas or tacos!! and get real..Locals...Mexicans don't eat burgers. Chinga.|negative
Rated Ordered from Zaffran some time back. The food was not bad. For the prices, it was strictly average. I did like the quality of produce they used, but the food was swimming in oil. Reminded me of the old days when you had to sieve out the oil from cheap takeaways. Not bad really.|negative
Rated Ambiance: Dull and lifeless. They need a serious revamp. The furniture and the eatery both are in the desperate need of a revamp. Food: We ordered white sauce pasta for kids,which came with the tomatoes ( I mean are you serious.) The vegetable sizzler with garlic sauce and mushroom was below average. The nazi veg sizzler was better. Chicken sizzler apprantly was relished by my non veg companions. Chilly garlic noodles were just a about average. All this for not a cheap price. Service: apparently there was only one server on the upper floor where we were sitting. May be he was over worked but he was just about reluctant for everything, whether it was about joining the seats for eight people or bringing the plates. Overall not a great experience. I don't think I would visit it anytime soon.|negative
Rated Being a true sizzler fan, this place was on my must visit list in Mumbai.. and after I visited the place I can easily say wherever you go your experience at kobe remains the same... I was a frequeng goer to the only one restaurant they had in Delhi for the amazing sizzlers they used to serve and the taste was pretty much the same at the Mumbai outlet as well.. the menu was a little limited at the Mumbai version but in terms of portion size, presentation and the taste, it was almost the Delhi kobe for me.. another thing which was similar to the Delhi version was the inefficient service and poor upkeep of the place (and I think this was the reason it was poorly rated, had fewer visitors and hence was closed down)... All in all, if u love sizzlers and going out means only food for u this place is a must go.. but if u r the one who is not a fan of sizzlers and pay heed to the ambience and service, just avoid... Since m the first category I wish with all my heart that Kobe comes back to Delhi...|negative
Rated Real bad. The sizzler was burnt as you can see in the pictures, we even found a strand of hair which is visible in the white plate. Completely dissatisfied, will never come back here.|negative
Rated Went here for my birthday and it was a crazy night. Food is great the drinks are crazy as shizz and with my friends this place rocked. I may not remember much from that night but I know that everything was perfect..!!|negative
Rated If you ignore the weird crowd that comes here, the place is actually not half bad. You can choose what you're in the mood for - loud music or a slightly less noisy evening basis which level you sit|negative
Rated Have a craving for junk food while roaming in bandra and want a better alternative then Macdonalds or KFC, head directly to this place and it won't disappoint, had ordered crispy chk burger meal and double XX Canadian chk wrap and both were very well prepared, the only downside of this place is that it's small and bugs flying even though it's AC, otherwise it's an excellent option.|negative
Rated I was hoping for more...not so much more on the food (that I knew was bit of a risk)...but on the service. We reached there around 10.15pm...and that, I realized, was the mistake. The staff was hurried, somewhat tired, confusing and pathetically slow at the same time. I was hoping that they would acknowledge our anniversary (which I had mentioned at the time of booking our table). That did not happen. What I could never figure out is why were two sets of people (one waiter and one staff in each set) serving us. Lastly, we ordered the kolokithi starter and the kous kous main course. Average at best. I have a lot of regard for Taj Hotels in general, but I won't recommend this restaurant.|negative
Rated This is a Fine Dining Specialised cuisine restaurant focused on Middle Eastern and Lebanese culinary arts! Everything is very special here! The smallest detail is a matter of concern to all of the team ! The Chiefs are the real thing! Highly trained and experienced artists! You should love humus and sesame seeds! Many people have an allergy! But not a problem; just tell your waiter ! But call ahead and book a chair at a table ! Christopher INDIA HOUSE pune|negative
Rated Had gone Farmhouse in evening to experience the soothing ambience ... The view is good with Sea nearby ... but instead my experience was ruined as there were too many mosquitoes... Because they themselves throw the waste or the garbage nearby... Can't you have a big dustbin and dump everything there... The 3 stars is for the service and the setup foe the table with the candle ... As far as food is concerned, I had visited with my friend , had Cheesy fingers in starters , which were just so ok... bcoz had sour cream taste rather than cheese... And Masala Papad was good to have... In drinks, we ordered Vasai Sunshine and Electric Lemon.. They were good..specially Vasai Sunshine... Main course comprised of Veg Dum Biryani which was not so good as they had not cooked it upto the mark... Overall , it wasn't great.. but if you dont have any options and wanna try seafood.. Then go for Farmhouse....|negative
Rated If I were to describe this place in one word : over rated. We made a reservation for 2 and were seated at the table right next to the entrance. There were a bunch of other empty tables but on requesting to be seated elsewhere, they refused to do so. Being an open roof restaurant, it was infested with mosquitos. Food taste - 4/5; portions : 3/5 Cost - 3/5 Service - 4/5|negative
Rated The food is highly overpriced and poor quality. I used to love the nachos here but the taste is all lost now. It isn't even a great place to hangout at. Overall Alfredo's is overrated.|negative
Rated Not good! The place was dirty when we entered. I was left with no option but to order 'Diet' coke as regular coke was not unavailable. The chicken I ordered was okayish. I hope the other outlets offer better food & service. A tad disappointed.|negative
Rated My review might not even match the average rating but this is based on the kind of service we got and what we had expected of Sheesha. The staff was least concerned to even take our order, we were sitting on the table for nearly 25 mins and nobody served us even a glass of water which is a basic courtesy. Finally a waiter came and we ordered a Masala rumali roti which is a signature dish at Sheesha restaurants. I was shocked looking at quantity of masala, we we even asked the waiter to get it checked but we got a straight forward answer that "itna masala hi aata hai". The rumali tasted good but it was the experience which made us go from their without ordering dinner.|negative
Rated I personally did not the like the food here. We ordered for bagel which had really bitter cucumber in it. They should add cucumbers only after tasting. We ordered 3 types of Maggi. All 3 were pathetic|negative
Rated One of the worst places for vegetarian food. In the restaurant they have smoked it with anti mosquito gases so heavily that you can hardly breathe. On top of that the good was awful. Beware.|negative
Rated Disappointed! I had gone with certain expectations and it didn't fare even close to it. Give it a miss. Seriously. The servers are clueless. They don't know jack about the dishes. The jalapeño poppers were decent. The lemon iced tea horrible and the ravioli okay-ish. The vibe was humdrum, the servers least bothered and the food forgettable. Juhu has a lot of better options specially for that pricing. They even refused to give us games saying it's Sunday and according to policy they don't give games on Sunday. Disappointing. Go to quench above or Starbucks below. Or another joint close by.|negative
Rated Iv always been a fan of Moshe.... The first outlet I went to was in Kemps Corner, inside crossword and I loved the concept of reading and having a hot coffee with desserts or sweet breads. I have visited the Juhu Moshe often as I live close by but over time it has REALLY disappointed me. I get the feeling the management doesn't care, staff is casual and not interested. The tables are dirty, the place looks shabby and all in all the quality of everything- food, service and the place has fallen drastically. I love u guys, please fix and I shall be back again �?😀|negative
Rated Horrible service. We came into a full cafe (this time the wrong indicator as this is a restaurant that needs to be avoided). 1. We were 4 people squeezed at a table for 2. When a bigger table was available the staff didn't bother to tell us. 2. Most of the dishes on the menu were not available. When I pointed it out to the waiter and asked him "how come?", he replied with facial expressions and gestures something that I interpreted as "what's your problem? You wanna fight?". 3. Everything took a long time to arrive / didn't arrive at the same time and we had to wait for all dishes to arrive to start together. 4. We often had to call the waiters two or three times before they came. And their general appearance was unfriendly and aggressive. (If this was Delhi, I would have probably had a street fight). 5. Water was dripping from a whole in the ceiling on my arm. I pointed it out to the waiter who replied.. " yeah yeah, that's just temporary." 6. When I asked for the bill, a man who seemed to be the manager throughout to our table. Not sure, I asked for the manager. He confirmed that he was the one. I told him I would like to share to points as feedback: unfriendly staff and water falling from the ceiling. He said sorry that's just temporary. (I wonder which one he meant. But won't go back to check.) gwendaglocalista.com|negative
Rated Had some Insane Chocolate Chip muffins!! �? �?�Must try..|negative
Rated Had their misal pav. I guess it was the worst I've ever had in my life. Wanted it without onion but didn't mention it as usually everyone gives it alag se, And wen I told the uncle at the counter he was like it wnt get replace, u shud had told before, we'll how wud a person know?? Had to buy a new one to eat. Staff was rude, full of attitude.|negative
Rated Street Foods by Punjab Grill is a food stall in the food court. The space and the design of the stall looks impressive. I ordered a Chinese Combo from Street Foods by Punjab Grill. The Chinese combo has Chicken Chowmein, Chilly Chicken and a coke. The pricing was around 300 for the combo. The food tasted disappointing. The noodles and the chilly chicken was loaded with MSG killing all the flavors within. However, the chicken was fried crisp and succulent and the sauce tasted fiery and good. Unfortunate that excessive MSG ruined the dining. All in all, I still had an ordinary experience considering that the food was served fast, priced budget-friendly. I would go with 3 out of 5 for Street foods by Punjab Grill, I would have loved my food had it not been for the huge quantity of MSG in my dish.|negative
Rated A friend took me here for the tikki chole and I must say it tasted delicious, also though coming from the jiggs kalra banner the place is not all that expensive which is a huge plus. But the chole bhature was a big disappointment,I'd expect more from a core Punjabi place.|negative
Rated The bane of having friends is that sometimes you don't get to choose where to eat. So there we were, in R City Ghatkopar, looking for a cheap place for our friend to treat before his bachelorhood is mercilessly taken away from him. A quick review of Zomato and we were ordering from this place (primarily because it served non-veg and was cheap relatively). Options here are more or less standard and truthfully, not much options either for dinner so we hastily ordered the only non-veg curry available (they generally have a different each day but it's the only one) with rotis, a chicken kheema biryani,veg platter and shikanji (another version of lime soda). While the veg platter and curry was just a standard one (I forgot the name), chicken kheema biryani and shikanji were very good (a surprise in a mall) especially the jeera (cumin seeds) in shikanji and very will spiced nature of the biryani. Overall, if you have the misfortune of coming to the mall for some purpose, you can easily try out the food from here and well, let's say you won't be disappointed.|negative
Rated Really really bad. So depressing that hospitality professionals have such a horrible attitude, where the "executive chef" says that an Eggs Benedict is not a Overly cooked poached egg (hard centre somehow) served on a bed of some cold rubbery chicken and topped with some cheese sauce. His excuse, "hum aise hi banate hai". Me - what? Manager must look into this. Very disappointing all around.|negative
Rated The food may not be so great but it is practically empty in the evenings. We went there a couple of days back as a group of about 20 ppl. It was hot as hell but once the drinks and conversation start flowing, you tend to pay less attention to the heat. Service is slow. The place still maintains its old school decor which I personally love. It has a permanent musty smell.|negative
Rated 5/5 for money value and affordability, 3/5 ambience, service is bit slow. They hav a gud variety in Indian food. When it comes to taste ordered for gilafi kebab which though delicious was so salty that was it was a task to finish it. We told the manager about same while ordering for maincourse which was bheja dry Tawa fry, some gosht Hari pyaz n mutter kheema and roomali roti but they did not bother to rectify their mistake and the kheema was so freaking salty tht this time we decided to leave it. So a big let down in terms of food it was Jus salt in everything which over powered the otherwise tasty food. If I will revisit? I might.. considering it's a budget friendly place for group dinner, the drinks are very cheap sply if you are cocktail fan you can easily try few drinks without bothering for budget.|negative
Rated Very disappointed !!!! Order for a sub for home delivery and even after 1.5 hours the sub wasn't delivered, and after calling them they say can you again give us the order all over again !!|negative
Rated One of the worst outlet of subway ; Always in shortage of bread or patties or veggies or sauces or cheese; First they accepted my order of Monday's sub of day & later on they told me they had no chicken ham in stock.And yeah they are always on shortage of change too. :/|negative
Rated i use to like this place for a quick snack.. but now all old STALE & smelly items. Sad to know they are no more up to the mark. Zero score..|negative
Rated Currently this place has a rating of 2.7 and I think it flatters it given the standards of this brand and this branch in particular. Hard to believe that this is the same brand where my brother learnt his trade as a chef at their flight kitchen. With time, they have lost relevance and definitely the quality that set them apart. To start with the basic concept of the Croissant remains good on paper. They still prepare the bread in the manner they used to years ago. On two counts, these breads are not worth feeding your enemy; Freshness and Fillings. The chicken croissant used to have strips and strips of boneless chicken which was delicately marinated and rich in yogurt. Today it’s a harsh spicy concoction with oversized pieces of capsicum, barely any chicken and oil. Freshness is a game of roulette as on some days the bread has been so stale it’s truly inedible. Their saving grace remains their cakes, rich in chocolate and moist between layers. Each time I’ve dropped in for one and attempted to see if they’ve changed their ways with the croissants I’ve been bitterly let down.|negative
Rated First of all a cockroach in one of the trays . After we asked him to throw that tray out , the store manager did it with much contempt . He punched a much costly item in our bill and was suspiciously asking us to pay for a consolidated bill and not a separate one . Then when we realised that he has added a costlier item in the bill , he argued with us for over 10 minutes . I was just short of making a police complaint against the manager !|negative
Rated Claimed that there was no one in the shop for home delivery. The phone number is also wrong. The correct one is 65248837. I would give it a miss - the last thing you want when ordering food is rude and obnoxious staff.|negative
Rated [Personal Review] The thing that pissed me off the most was the only dish I ordered, the night of the Trivia in Feb, was the 'Grilled Cheese with Chilly Slider'. Forget the wait time, which was 45mins, but what I got was an open style Chilly Cheese toast you get at a sandwich stall for under Rs. 100! It was literally 4 pieces of pav with chilly cheese toast topping on it! Accompanied by some salad, that I feared touching, and some 4 pieces of french fries. Guess what the bill was - Rs. 500 (after taxes, get added). It's not like I haven't paid this much for sliders, starters, or even a burger, but the fact that I got 'Cheese Chilly Toast' is what pissed me off. And from the time taken to get it to the table, it literally felt like some waiter ordered an Uber on Surge pricing to go to a sandwich stall that was open, make the Uber wait, and come back with it. Though I think that waiter ate half of my chilly cheese toast, since there were only 4 pieces when served and to compensate they gave some fries & leaves. That's the only way to justify this dish & the cost associated with it. A humble request to the chef or owner: Please google 'sliders' and please start serving that instead. FYI, the monthly trivia nights at this place is great, one of the best in the city. After my experience in Feb, I returned for the Trivia night in March, played and then ran over to Doolally to grab a bite to eat. #Truestory Also this place is not vegetarian friendly! Not even a veg burger on the menu. My entire rating & review is based on that one dish I ordered and not the drinks or trivia night. petpujaris.com|negative
Rated Been here to try their fusion pani puri on a friend's recommendation. Something very unique served with quinoa and Kala Katha instead of your normal meethi chutney. The name twisted pani puri makes sense too. Killer Stuff!! --A drop of ink may make a million think. @AyaashPaw pawanmanghnani.com|negative
Rated So after our fantastic 2 visits, the third visit turned out to be a complete nightmare! I ordered for Turkish Punjabi(vegetarian). I being a vegetarian, was served a Mutton dish, and I almost had it! Unacceptable! It's suchha shame how a place like this could goof up so bad, they've always impressed me with their food and service, made suchha huge mistake! And moreover, the behaviour of the manager was completely unapologetic. Huge let down!|negative
Rated Ordered in on Sunday for dinner. The mixed meat salad was terrible. No taste and stale ingredients. The watermelon feta was ok, didn't do justice to the description on the menu but was edible.|negative
Rated Considering the location, I thought service would be more prompt here, instead though it was empty, we were kept waiting for the longest time and then even served 2 simple americanos very roughly, without even cleaning the table, which was dirty. I think the whole chain should work on training their employees as competition is high and every time i go to one of their outlet it never seems to fail in disappointing me! Of the new items of the menu, I was really let down by the nachos, it's basically packaged tortillas chips on which they pour some bad salsa and cheese (really little) and then microwaved. A small and tasteless portion... quite bad!|negative
Rated I use to visit CCD out of india only for their hot chocolate. The disappointment is Indian CCD doesn't serve the drink which has same taste. Nothing bad but the quality of chocolate is different.|negative
Rated Unbelievable thing happened the other day. I ordered a cappuccino and while drinking felt the cup was a little heavy. I did not think much of it and drank a quarter of it till I saw a metallic object in my drink. It was a part of the coffee machine which the Barista accidentally dropped into my coffee and served it. Appalled by the service and hygiene factors at this outlet.|negative
Rated Disgusting! I ordered 3 plum cakes from there website on 19th December. Got phone call from them 23rd saying that cakes will be delivered on 26th. There was no reply to the email. Today on 27th when I phoned them they tell us that they do not have any cakes in stock! And so we won't get the cakes. How is that for service?|negative
Rated The food is ok,the menu don't have choice for vegetation eater,the choice is limited Service is good Disappointment in menu with limited choice and also the breads were too hard to chewing Need more variety at this place to choice|negative
Rated This is a typical restaurant located inside a five star hotel. Serves indian food and overall scores average on my food scale. Not for hard core Desi food lovers as the tastes are toned down and the spices are little boring. Best suited to take your firang office colleagues for dinner/ lunch as I feel that the place is made for the people who can not eat real indian spicy food.|negative
Rated Rude lounge, Manpada has valet parking. That's what attracted me first. Haha. I love the upper deck. I've been here several times and I know I'll always choose this place over any random lounge. The ambience is 5/5. Music is 5/5. Food is 5/5. The service is a little slow. And the waiters are a little ignorant. You've got to call them 5 times and that's when they'll attend you. But that doesn't ruin the place. It's a 5/5 for a locality like thane.|negative
Rated The portion size of the biryani was the main issue, while we find it difficult to finish one portion of Khane Khas biryani between 2 people, I found the portion to be just a little smaller here. But the pricing is also smaller, so that's a good point. The taste of our chicken tikka biryani was wonderful and I had to ignore the film of oil at the bottom of the container.. Biryani is cooked with lots of oil after all. The stuffed mushroom appetizer had a very chunky filling, wish it was more delicate. Will try their curries next time.|negative
Rated Went for lunch. Been going to Mahesh for years. Today the food was just terrible. Ordered squid butter pepper garlic, fried rawas and prawns koliwada. The prawns were tasteless and burnt, the fish was average and the squid was just floating in butter. There was no mutton available, meaning come on. The mains were just about pass class. When I returned the prawns to the manager and a waiter. They came back and said they are just fine and got extremely defensive. I think next time it will be back to Trishna. Poor poor experience. Not going back|negative
Rated So I order a Paneer Tikka Biryani. Guess what? ZERO PANEER. No Raita. No papad. No pickle. Nothing. 1 hr wait with no confirmation as the call centre had no clue about my order. Then upon calling to complain again call centre is clueless and saying they cant find my order only?! Queations upon questions. But no solution. Bad Module. Bad Execution.|negative
Rated For first timers its okay But if u have already tasted andhra food, this you would find average. All the food tastes same, all are sour. No spice in any of the item. For me, no second visit.|negative
Rated Just deleted my 5 star rating and I'm Re-reviewing this place. This place has two faces: 1. When the owner takes your order you can expect to receive great food, in 45 minutes max. 2. When the owner is not around some idiot from the kitchen takes your order and their already ill-mannered staff turns into a bunch of cheats, and you recieve cold, bad food in 2 hours. Also, the expensive toppings are missing and when you confront them about the same they blatantly claim that the toppings are there and the customer is lying. And when you threaten to land up at the outlet with the food to expose them they say that the chef made a mistake and forgot to put the toppings. Forgot? Did he forget to take my money? And this has happened thrice. So, this place is avoidable.|negative
Rated Expextations high reality 0 ... Worst place of viiviana i guess.... staff was with an attitude nature.... food was tasteless... chicken platter was bad... quantity was jst for a singl person... plateing ws worst... music was too loud... have such a place n without washroom... when i askd staff for washroom they askd for common washroom of mall... Ambience 3/5 Food 3/5 Staff 2/5|negative
Rated We friends were planning to head to Jugheads on the weekend but as it was full the manager asked us to head to Slice of Lime instead which is right next door and owned by them aswell. We din't mind trying something new so we went there. Firstly it's a place to sit and have drinks with friends, occasionally staring at the Sports Screen when you'r bored :P It's definitely not a place to have food. Unlike Jugheads, i found the food here to be really bad. We'd ordered a mocktail which had a really bad taste, we had to mix beer in it to finish it. We'd ordered a Chilly Paneer which was normal. The vegetable steak peri peri has not that good, the oriental pizza hardly had any toppings and was divided into 4slices only. The portion sizes are small compared to the normal rates that they charge and the food isn't even worth it. They always have offers on drinks, even during weekends so if you plan on drinking and lazying then it could be an option, not otherwise!|negative
Rated Great ambience,food was also good.THe portion size served was satisfactory.They had IPL screening on 3 to 4 places in the bar which added to the chill factor.But I felt that the drink were slightly overpriced considering its right next to diner's lounge.Also draught beer was unavailable and there was a group creating lots of noise and ruckus but no one said them anything.|negative
Rated Don't know why this place was so overcrowded! Vada Pav here is just like any other normal Vada Pav stall's in mumbai. But the place is definitely overpriced may be because of their over hyped name.|negative
Rated yummy farali misal and thalipeeth. Solkadhi was the only disappointment. I was craving for puneri flavors and this place did make up for my cravings!|negative
Rated The food here is actually okay but when I visited I was so disappointed in the service. The staff is completely ignorant and it took forever to get the attention of someone to get our order taken. After hearing much about the bandra outlet I decided to try this place and it was quite a bad experience. In terms of food the chicken khaosway is good. Soup was quite tasteless and shanghai chicken appetizer was alright. Honestly was quite put off by the service to review the food.|negative
Rated Twice that we have landed up here famished and hogged on the buffet spread with beer and wine. Though I'd still say the Pali Hill place of Lemon Leaf is more fun simply because of the location, this one more closer to home satiates quite in the same manner. The buffet is a steal and not much to report on ambiance but the food is worth checking this place out. The owner was busy chit chatting with guests but he never offered us beer. 😛@|negative
Rated I've come here over the years and this visit has shocked me! The place is in a dismal state. They don't stock most of the alcohol mentioned in the menu! The seats are torn! Overall it's just dirty and uneasy now.|negative
Rated One of my favourite restaurants in south Mumbai, I used to frequent this place at least once a week. Absolutely smashing food and great cocktails. I don't think I have ever had a bad meal at this place its been consistently good, though I must confess I haven't been here much in the last 5 years. My favourites here are their momos, Vietnamese cold spring rolls, kaukswe, Thai curries and a Thai fish with lime, chilly and garlic. And to end the meal the chocolate fondant which oozes chocolate as soon as u dig your spoon into it.|negative
Rated Pebbles is the sister concern of melting pot . The food served here is equivalent to that which is served in melting pot just out of the world|negative
Rated This place has the most ill mannered staff in the entire of industry! Please do not come here.. Ever !! The waiter by the name of Barman is the worst in customer handling.. Horrible person! Pathetic customer service.. Had come here for some celebration - messed up the entire mood !! Mr Thakur is the most arrogant Resturant manager you will find in the Resturant business.. Sad!! Deserves to be sacked.. Any decency in the management get in touch with me .. I'll explain the crap that went down !!!|negative
Rated COLLEGE DAYS CHERISHED FOR MANY !!! In early days of his career... Nandu satrted from almost this very place selling dosa and so on... In recent years... hes expanded from one stall to another.. and also running an ac hotel near MK college. His hard work and dedication can be seen and its been paid off. _________________ Coming to this road side outlet... do try their chocolate dosa bhaji dosa and Manchurian dosa. _________________ Ratings : Food: 4/5 Ambience: Its an open stall.|negative
Rated Not too different from the other Theobromas in terms of quality, other than the variety and the size. Because the area is limited, they obviously don't cater beyond a point, and when they're sold out in cheese cake, they have a stiff competition from Love and Cheesecake which is next door. Still, it delivers on the Theobroma name so no complaints.|negative
Rated Based in the heart of lokhandwala and serves yum dishes. (as per the menu) Pav bhaji deinitely was a big turn off tastewise and it also gave a negative effect on the stomach. Dosas are alright and tea is just basic. Very very overpriced as per the food and the service... Sorry high point but the experience wasnt one to recommend.|negative
Rated Average at best. Not a late night place to go to. During late evenings they just seem to be wasting electricity. Found no customers in the eating area at 11 pm and about 4-5 'left over' donuts . They also don't make donuts in the shop so beware of stocks running out before they close the shop. I would rather go to Mad Over Donuts.|negative
Rated Had come to PVR citimall for a movie, so thought of just grabbing a bite before going for the movie so thought of going to Dunkin' Donuts.. We ordered Wedges, Lemon Ice Tea, Black Coffee & Death By Chocolate Donut.. The ambience I really liked a nice colourful place.. I really liked everything that i ordered except the Lemon Ice Tea I found it too bitter I really don't know why it didn't have any sugar or syrup which was kinda disappointing to have an ice tea which is bitter .. But the donut was yumm! The wedges were really delicious & the black coffee was perfect!|negative
Rated Landed here on Friday night after watching a movie at PVR Citi Mall. We got here around 10 and managed to get a table in the outside section which was not bad or hot at all. I was hungry as Hell and all I craved was a creamy pasta. So as soon as I got the menu I turned over the pages until I seen the Pasta section and decided to order the Penne with Chicken and Pesto Cream. They have quite a few options in Pasta. My friend got really excited looking at the main course options in fish as he eats only fish and no other meat and decided to order the Grilled King fish. A very courteous waiter comes over to take our order. The moment I order the Grilled fish he says that the fish will take around 45 minutes to be served and we agree. The very next moment he asks us to order anything else apart from fish as the kitchen is busy. We tell him we will wait but he just won't agree to take an order that involved fish in it. We both look at each other baffled and look around confused. Granted the place was busy but there were quite a few empty tables. Anyway we didn't want to create a fuss as we were in a good mood so he just ordered a spinach and mushroom omlet. The food arrived quickly and the portion and taste of the pasta was incredible. I basically inhaled my food but for the first time I was struggling to finish it all given the quantity. The omlet was impressive too and it came along with 4 slices of brown bread toast which was left untouched as he is a fitness freak (I cannot imagine a world without bread and rice thou). Service was quite questionable as I had to ask thrice for my glass of water to be refilled and not forgetting the busy kitchen syndrome. Overall a decent place to dine. They play good music and also screen the IPL matches. Hopefully my friend will be served fish next time (if there is a next time).|negative
Rated Horrendous food, bad pizza, bruschetta was just pizza sauce, spaghetti bad, chicken was stinking, bad service, bad lighting!! Disappointed as was once a favourite!!|negative
Rated I have been a regular to the 7 bungalow's outlet but came here for the first time. Apart from a little bland behaviour from the staff, this branch has all the flavours and vibes of the 7 bungalow branch. Cold coffee is a must try and if you take hard drinks, try mixing rum in it. The taste is just a marvel. Pasta's are yum and so are the sizzlers.|negative
Rated Since the memories of yummilicious sizzlers from my last visit here...kept haunting me; I decided to quiten my hunger demon and obliged to its demand by revisiting the old haunt 😊 The joint was packed to capacity. And that too on a monday evening. If weekdays are this crowded; I wonder how it is on weekends. Called for grilled prawns sizzler with afrikano sauce and my better half ordered a Pop tates ka cheesy chicken sizzler. After a long wait...the sizzlers arrived. They were sizzling hot...so hot that after a minute or so...unable to hold any longer when I impatiently took a dig I scalded my tongue. And it continued to sizzle and crackle till my last bite. The sizzlers were scrumptious but the mexican rice that accompanied it was not as good as the last time..|negative
Rated Not a good experience though. This was the 1st time that I tasted their food. (Ordered food home) I craved for pizza and ordered for a bbq pizza ( to much Masala ) and chicken lollipops (tasteless). I'm Sorry but they Were pathetic. I don't how the other food tastes. But by these two I don't think I would ever get back to This place.|negative
Rated I miss time when i used to come here for their crazy shakes and juices. This was like 3 to 4 years ago when they were literally serving some great juices. Now this place has a brand name and its become more commercial. Lately i had been to this place and i ordered the mango mulberry shake. The shake was more of mulberry than mango in it and it was too icy. Not expected from a place like this.|negative
Rated I tried ordering from this place because of its 3.9 Zomato rating and the food was ghastly. Oily, spicy- it was a complete mess. Had to down half a Limca just to wash it down. Made me really question the ratings given.|negative
Rated At Indigo Deli, the fillet mignon is locally procured Buffalo Tenderloin. It is served with roasted onions, garlic, red wine juice and a choice of mashed potatoes or grilled vegetables. Other Than Steak: If you don’t like beef, try the Deli fried chicken with apple slaw or the Risotto of wild mushrooms and red wine.|negative
Rated Was in infinity and we were craving for some burgers.. we ordered 1 tandoor grilled burger, 1 chix nuggets and as the lady suggested to try their new spicy Angreiest burger, tried the same.. Everything was just yum but the Angriest burger was a bit to angry(lol) and spicy. It had a reddish color bread and was no doubt tasty but in the end the spicy sauce was a bit too much.. I will definitely eat it again but with a bit less of spicy sauce... Cheers!!!|negative
Rated I don't know what went wrong with Burger King in this location. There was hardly any salad in the Veggie burger we asked for. The parties in the other burger was ice cold. They were too slow in getting back after giving the order and in a mall u r usually tired after shopping and have to hunt for a place to sit, order and take the food on your own, so all this adds up if the food isn't good.|negative
Rated Huma might be one of the shabbiest mall in the city. It is like walking through ruins. They've got some guts to open up in such a place. 😷 The ambience is the usual fine dine. The food is average. Had ordered the chicken sweet corn soup which was just okay. When browsing through an exhaustive menu, thought about getting some recommendations from the staff. It was a wasted attempt as he couldn't explain anything. The funniest of replies were like.." Sir, chicken and gravy hoga".. " sir, usmein chicken aayega..aisey (he gestured the shape of a cup with his hands)" ...I was like, wow! I asked a tricky question...didn't I? 😜 I went with what I thought would be best and the dragon chicken was served. It was nice, hot and flavourful. The service was good throughout. It was followed by an American chicken chop suey which was too much in quantity and mediocre in taste. A bit expensive considering, you ain't happy right from the time you walked through the shabby ruins and will be walking all the way back through the same after having average food.|positive
Rated Decided to go there after watching movie in huma but was not a good decision! Food is decent but prices of both food and drinks are quite high which is not worth to spend here! Staff is not active, service is slow.|positive
Rated First attempt at any outlet in the Bhandup area. Shabbiest mall ever! All empty, odd structure. Anyway enough to if that, back to the store. Food: 3.5/5. Average menu, tried the basic Indian items and were good enough. Service: 4/5. Good service, decent waiters. They were helpful and always available. Ambience: 2/5. Tried very very hard at a good ambience but did not come out right. The people there were also odd. Don't go on a date there. Friend groups can have fun. Prices: 3/5. Average, not high not low. Affordable. Overall it is the best joint in that location, so if you are there like me and need a bite to eat it won't hurt to go there.|positive
Rated This place serves one of the better Mutton Biryanis. Nicely cookes mutton in rice cooked with a little bit of ghee. Never crowded. Best part is the music. They play mostly the gazals. Good place to hangout with friends and sipping a couple of drinks.|positive
Rated Yet another a fine dine bar with nice ambiance and average food. It is mostly in lines of other one level up bars with better food, service and ambiance. Drinks are priced average and not cheap but considering the ambiance and service they are quite acceptable. Ambiance is very light and sophisticated ideal for family dining and even work meetings. Not much is there for young people but that is not an issue. Staff is good and knows their job well. They will also help well with deciding your order. Food is average and here lies the reason why abhinandan, laxmi and appetite which are not very far from here are more preferable to this place. I had veg spring rolls and surmai masala. Spring Rolls were a bit below average and hardly pleased me while the fish curry was better and highly spiced as i demanded. But still the gravy was killing the basic texture of fish and authenticity was compromised. In all ill say to skip this place as many better options are available. My Rating: 1. Food: 3/5 2. Ambiance: 3.5/5 3. Service: 3.5/5 4. Value of Money: 3/5 neverknowsbest.in|positive
Rated Har been here today for ofc lunch....with team...kebabs were good but biryqani was disappointing..it was really spicy....veg crispy wqs also good.....good fo kebabs..service is also good.....|positive
Rated Cost of items is slightly high. Ambience is good. Taste is not so good but average. Once can try it once. I am rating it 3.5 because of high cost.|positive
Rated Ambience is good. The food is average and the rates are affordable. A good place to hangout if you want a nice and quiet atmosphere. They don't serve beer in mugs but instead in huge glasses which was not quite what I expected though �?.|positive
Rated Tis place is a place ever crowded n people are in the quee to dine here Good interior good food best staff The food is good typical North Indian food but with South Indian touch to it The chicken handi is to die for Even the veg preparation is good But the worst thing is delivery thing which I guess tey hav stopped|positive
Rated Food was fantastic things i didn't like was the service n some technical restaurant aspects ...you need to keep your tables n table cloth clean n the associates i.e servers should look after guest more prominently like giving menu card water etc.. N last and the foremost build a better washroom please.|positive
Rated The food was pretty good but the service is pretty lousy. I would rate in minus for the waiters here as they were pretty rude to us. My order didn't come in time either given that it was a weekday. I wouldn't advise girls to visit this place because the place is just not appropriate.|positive
Rated Once again typically Mumbai Bar. Good place to hangout with out buddies and having drinks. It is close to Bhandup Station. Food taste is good.|positive
Rated We visited this place on my sister birthday. We where gang of 12 kids included. It's good that family restaurant and bar is detaches. Ambience is not so good. Feels like you entered in haunted house. But food was excellent. They do have variety to serve.|positive
Rated This was my first in Bhandup. Prices are a bit steep for the quantity, but food is nice. Biryani was spicy but likable. Had egg curry another time and it was not bad. Waiters are efficient but order is sometimes late. Try this one if you are hungry after getting down at the station.|positive
Rated Near to the station..so no problem after getting drunk to get back home indirectly to travel Having good taste and proper service Waiters are polite I tried tandoori, paneer chilly dry,butter chicken it was awesome to taste Bit high in cost but as a bar its all fine To chill out wid fam or frnz it is good place|positive
Rated Very nice taste.We used to order parcel from here.One should try butter chicken,it is awesome. Tandoori is also nice.It is located near station area.|positive
Rated Small restaurant just outside the Railway Station on the Western side.Reasonable is the first word that comes to mind. The Paneer Bhurji here is most unique I have ever had. I would visit this place just to have this Paneer Bhurji.Chicken dishes are good too.|positive
Rated Its an ok ok place the quntity of food is ok but the quality i didnt find it much great. Felt the chicken was not cooked as it was taking time to chew.|positive
Rated Food over here is really amazing💋 n tasty�?..d chicken�?� is tendered 😊n juicy😀..Butter chicken is gr8😇..lollypop r good n juicy😆..Chicken Angara�? was good..Chicken biryani😘😘 is good..v called for home delivery d service☺ is so quick that with in 15min🕑 d food was delivered💃💃💕💗💙...small quantity order is also been delivered.😊. Very easy on pockets💸💰💳..quantity �?is good with good quality.👌|positive
Rated Ordered some food from Maaz. Definitely value for money. Also, quantity of food is more than expectation. I have to agree that the taste is not the authentic moghlai that we usually look for. However, the taste is pretty good which makes up for the lost authenticity! Chicken tandoori and Tangdi biryani were really good. Best option for some sasta sundar tikau stuff ;)|positive
Rated If you consider the pricing, the place is more than worth the food it serves. Butter Chicken for 2 at less than 100 bucks. Tried the Chicken crispy too and it was on par. The Caramel Custard though, is out of the world.|positive
Rated Me and my wife had ordered food for delivery from Cafe Maaz for lunch on a weekend. We had a Full Tandoori chicken for the appetizers, Chicken Biryani and Chicken Tikka Biryani for the mains and Caramel Custard for the desserts. The full tandoori chicken was served as one full tandoor cooked bird. Visually the chicken was presented weird. The chicken could very easily be disjointed but the presentation for me felt lazy. The flavor however, was spot on! A good tandoori chicken would have a chicken drumstick cooked white throughout and yet succulent. A great tandoori chicken would have chicken breast cooked moist and succulent and that was what I got! The chicken breast here was beautifully cooked. It cut like butter and at the same time had a wonderful texture of the chicken breast. The vegetable salad served along with the chicken did not taste fresh while the pudina chutney had an overwhelming flavor of green chillies blowing away my palate. The chutney hardly had any refreshing flavor of mint and curd. The chicken biryani tasted disappointing. The rice hardly had any flavor of the meat or spices. This left an unsatisfactory connection between the rice and meat thereby killing the essence of a biryani. The rice was not basmati rice as well. The chicken was beautifully cooked while the masala did not capture the flavor of the spices. The chicken tikka biryani tasted similar except for the chicken tikka in the biryani and rice cooked in cumin. The rice felt cheap like the one in chicken biryani. Overall my experience with the biryani was bad. The caramel custard tasted absolute yum. It tasted very light and refreshing. The dish was not bitter as well and that is a relief! I do not remember when I last tasted a non-bitter caramel custard. I loved the dish! All in all I would go with 3.5 out of 5 for Cafe Maaz. A very good Tandoori chicken and caramel custard ruined by a weird tasting biryani.|positive
Rated I liked this place and the food here. Mutton dishes are good but only 2 pcs/serving (however negotiable considering low cost). Always crowded, friendly waiters; both AC and non-AC sections are there. Biryanis are average.|positive
Rated This place serves one of the best non veg food...i have been here around 4-5 times and i wasnt disappointed anytime. Though they should try getting different flavours as i have felt the same flavour for few dishes here. What is interesting about this place is the cost. Very feasible for the pocket.|positive
Rated Maaz is very well know for its biryani With low price and great tasty non veg food I will surely recommend u for maaz!!! Ambiance is not that good , not even their services people only come here for the taste!!!!|positive
Rated cafe maaz is one of the best restaurant in bhandup that i have come across, it satisfies your hunger and goes easy on your pocket, i mean where will you get chicken dishes only for 95rs and the quantity is so much that 2 people can easily eat, even quality wise it's very good, their chinese is really good and tasty. i think you should not hesitate while ordering from here but just order and enjoy the food.|positive
Rated This place was recommended by a friend and we ordered from Zomato yesterday. The delivery took almost and hour but surprisingly the food was worth the wait. The chicken satey is a must try and the noodles were satisfactory. toutlemondepeutcuisiner.wordpress.com|positive
Rated Finally a decent restaurant that serves good veg fare and the price justifies the quantity. This is one of the few restaurants in bhandup that function post 12 am and being a night owl usually end up having my late night dinners here. The food quality is very good the waiters are courteous and the ambience is quiet. It does not serve liquor and hence does not invite a noisy crowd. The place also provides a 10 percent discount if you order a home delivery from their website and the owner is kind enough to let you use the wifi if you ask. I keep going back to this restaurant for the only reason that the quantity is so good that one portion of a vegetable or rice is filing for a family of two.|positive
Rated This is a new restaurant in Bhandup West with nice seating arrangements. The food quality is good, North Indians would love the taste, however it is somewhat expensive. Overall, a decent place to dine out.|positive
Rated The restaurant is quite small and very brightly lit, the ambience is not so good but the food is tasty. The service is good. A good place for a takeout or a quick meal, not great for dates or a nice family dinner. It is now becoming our favorite place to get home delivery. Their portions are generous and food is tasty. Tangdi kebab is so far my favorite dish from Fuzion's.|positive
Rated The ambience is good food quality is also up to the mark but the quantity is a bit less according to price ₹900 would be appropriate for 2 people overall its nice|positive
Rated My daughters 2nd Birthday was celebrated at Fuzion's. It was a very special day for my daughter and I chose Fuzions to throw a party for 30 people. Food at Fuzions is very delicious. We had Soup followed by two starters in veg and two starters in non veg which was followed by main course. Each and every guest was complimenting the food and the service. They liked the food a lot. Ambience of Fuzions is too good. Mr Choudhary has hired the best cooks in the industry. I have been a regular guest at Fuzions and I would give it 5 Stars.|positive
Rated Very few places in Mumbai will offer you good momos but this is an exception. Lying just outside kanjurmarg station ,you can satiate you momos need .the menu offers a good variety ,food is fresh and prices are reasonable too. The staff can be little friendly|positive
Rated Being from Delhi-NCR, I can say the momos they serve are pretty decent. The have lots of varieties of momos, in both fried and steamed, and the price is also good|positive
Rated Fairly decent as per Mumbai standards of momos. A lot of options available too! I found the filling to be good, but what left me somewhat disappointed was the skin of the momos. It felt simply too thick, and made the momos chewy. Spoilt the fun of steamed momos. Better to have such momos fried. Pricing and quantity is spot on. The food seems to be hygienically prepared. Worth a visit.|positive
Rated The place is very near to Kanjur marg station and also near to the lbs road. Everything about this place is excellent. Each variety of momos, taste is awesome. Just one problem is that the shop is too small and there is very small place to stand and eat.|positive
Rated I'm amazed by the amount of flavours they get into those little momos. Every bite decorates your palate and leaves you wanting for more. Super easy on the pockets!|positive
Rated This is right outside the busy Kanjurmarg station. And this is very popular cos it sells what other fast food joints in the street don't. And that's momos. For max budget of 80 bucks you're guaranteed to have your tummy full. Definitely a bang for a buck place to eat. Will try out their steamed momos and their mutton momos soon (provided it's in Stock).|positive
Rated Authentic momos from North East. Good to taste and more than enough quantity for snack of two in one plate. Do try out the chicken achari and the fried momos out here. ??|positive
Rated This place really works well with college crowd, students and other youngsters. Unlike other expensive momos outlets, they have managed to keep prices low. You will always get fresh supply of momos here as people keep buying till 10 pm. I tried vegetable and chicken momos. Dish was extremely hot and that is how it should be. They give red sauce ( schezwan I guess ) along with curd based sauce with momos. I personally like spicy sauce with momos and the red sauce was up to the mark. Though the address here says its in bhandup , its actually near kajurmarg station. The place gives ample varieties of steamed and fried momos in descent prices.|positive
Rated I used to avoid their signature chilli Cheesy Momo as it is only available with the fried variant. After having finally tasted this upon recommendation of the store in charge, I must admit I haven't tasted something as heavenly as this, the other momos are pretty good too, but try the chilli cheesy one (veg), it is a cut above the rest. The Achari momos are amazing as well. Overall this is a really good place to grab that quick bite after a long day of work.|positive
Rated We had heard about this restaurant for its food and it's chant going on in d restaurant. So me and my family visited this place for dinner and tried our hands on its Thai soup it was delicious but munchow soup was OK. Then tried its sabjhi and roti. One was veg hydrabadi and other veg Nawabi. Both were good, one can try it's food. The rates here are reasonable.|positive
Rated After free food at bhandup .. thought to have desserts nearby ... stepped in and ordered gopalas special falooda .. they gave me a dirty spoon and plate bit disappointed .. falooda was awesome loved it. They need to change cutlery.|positive
Rated A really good joint for all cuisine.. Great chinese, punjabi and pizzas. The Naan's are really good and the quality of food you get here is great. Loved veg. Nawabi and paneer mumyaz/lazeez. The mocktails are not good though!|positive
Rated Good casual dining place with pocket friendly price and huge menu options. Food quality is decent and quantity is good. Went there twice but both the time found there service to be slow.|positive
Rated Actually this place is in Kanjurmarg west. I usually order home delivery from here as it is near to my place. Everything is tasty here, from dosas, pav bhaji, pizza, idli, coconut chutney and sambhar are more awesome. This place is near to station. Evening usually is packed and weekends you will have to wait in queue for the table. It is because of tastiest food people come here.|positive
Rated This one is a kind of restaurant where you can eat all you want.... Literally all you want and the bill doesn't exceed 150 per person!!!! I have been here twice and each exoericnce was tasty and happy. My first visit, we sat in the A/c hall and it was quite spacious, and a bit crowded due to the afternoon time where people form nearby areas come to have their lunch. J have heard a lot about this restaurant form my fellow foodie buddies. This place deserves A tag, "Light on pocket, but not on your tummy!!!" We ordered some new items i.e Veg. Peshawari, masala kulcha and rumali roti. Each of these was tasty even by itself. The sabji was medium spicy with delicious gravy and yummy and soft kofta. The rumali roti was super thin and buttery. The masala kulcha was tasty too. Then we ordered a buttermilk and lassi, and this drinks made the whole lunch complete and I didn't even have any space left for ice cream!!! And the bill didn't even cross 320!!! That too in the a/c section. Its the best place to treat your friends. The food is awesome and the prices are totally worth it!!! Then I visited this place recently... and that experience was a bit disappointing. We friends were on a road trip and we didn't have a poroer meal for the whole day, so some 6 in the evening we all were damn hungry and so I suggested this place.... We went in there , the a/c hall was booked, but fortunately we got seats in the ground floor without any waiting. Then later my friends started complaining that its a vegetarian hotel, I said come on guys, its a very famous hotel , aaj ek din veg kha lo!!!! Then after a lot of discussion and fights we settled for some two sabji and then when we were placing our order the guy said yeh Sab 7 baje k Baad milega!!! Again I had to hear the taunts of my friends. Then I said ek mendu wada and ek misal pav leke aao and by the time he brought that we were ready with out order. We went for shezwan fired rice and panner burnt noodles. The menduwada tasted so good, I guess that was cause our growling tummies got something to work on, but the misal pav was not that satisfying. Then after a loong wait of 7-8 minutes we were served with tasty Chinese food. The quantity was very disappointing though and the food got over in less then a couple of minutes. The panner noodles were a good treat with the soft panneer bearing a Chinese tastem the fried rice were very average. Then we decided to go some where else where my find suggested ek papper masala dosa mangao, that would be good. So we went for it and it was the best decision of the day!!! The dosa was 1.5 feet long and covered most of our table!! I expected it to be bing , bit this big!!! Then we all dug in and it tasted great too. It was totally crisp and had a buttery taste. The masala was less in quantity, the chutney was chilled and the sambhar was warm!!! It had a really yummy effect on our tastebuds!!! And with the end of the dosa, it also ended our hunger strike!!! It was totally every single penny!!! So guys this place has some really tasty treats at really affordable prices, its a must try if you are in the localtiy!!|positive
Rated I have visited Gopalas Bits and Bites and Gopalas Next and I put Kanjur's Gopalas veg kitchen as second best in the list. Chinese food is nice, not too spicy and that's good. I have visited too many times and the experience was good.|positive
Rated The only decent place in the long stretch. I think it instantly became a common place for the locals. The food is decent. I had order parcel many times. Overall good.|positive
Rated The food is good. Though some of the items were bit oily. Different varieties of food choices are available (veg only). Ambiance is good. Pav bhaji is a must try.|positive
Rated The best hotel one can find after a night movie at Huma.. The ambience is good enough and the food which they provide is 100% veg. So it was very useful for me during Tuesday and Thursday?|positive
Rated Initially the food served was delicious but since last three orders we have noticed that the chicken is not tender at all and the food prepared is not fresh . My recommendations would be to serve fresh chicken .|positive
Rated If anyone is a chinese lover one should order from here ....Quantity was amazing...food tasted very good and even the delivery tymings are good..! IWill definately order again....|positive
Rated Ordered through food panda. Quantity was sufficient only for one guy. Ordered Garlic chicken rice, it was little spicy but worth it. If I had to go out for Asian or Chinese cuisine I would go rather to 5 Spice or Mainland China.|positive
Rated If any one is a lover of Chinese food..u should go to bell pepper... Assoume taste heart food quality,delivery timings is very gud...I love the name of the restaurant...|positive
Rated Must say that the order placed was delivered promptly The quantity & quality was too good , Much appreciated . The Supreme exotic tasted good recommended|positive
Rated This place is good as same as every natural ice cream parlour The anjeer one is my all time favourite The waffles available are also good But I prefer eating on cup Have tried all the flavours They truly are on their name Natural ... The flavour gives the exact taste like fruits Only bad thing if tis place is no place to sit n enjoy the ice cream|positive
Rated 10 out of 5. Best ice cream in India. Try all the flavors and you will surely fall in love with it. Each and every outlet of naturals ice cream serves the same quality. Price is also cheap for this kind of testy ice cream. Even if I love all the flavors but still if you try their tender coconut flavor you can't resist yourself to have that everyday. Every outlet of natural's are identical but it may happen that the availability of all the flavors may varie this is because of their huge popularity. But still you can find the common flavors anytime. A scoop will cost you 50 bugs and if you want it with a wafer it will cost only 10bugs extra. And for a large bucket it cost only 235 bugs which is quite cheap. You don't have to pay any extra tax here. All the flavors are of same price. Unfortunately you can't find any proper tables here but still there is some chairs for you. It is recommend for take away ,they do a really good packaging to take the ice cream home. Overall must visit for every ice cream lover. :)|positive
Rated It's the most exciting place and not a single flavour should disappoint you. so good. The first flavour i tried , probably 5 years ago , was the tender coconut one. I still remember ; i thought how could they possibly make this taste like tender coconut. By the end i think the only difference between the icecream and original tender coconut was that the icecream was chilled... Hailing from Kerala ive had more tender coconuts that a lot of people but this was so authentic i couldnt believe 😭 Choco almond is great , choco cream is so smooth and creamy ofc , one of my favourite. Had sitaphal flavour for new year's ,Ok Wow. I literally cannot imagine how they get those flavours.|positive
Rated I don't know why we need to make a review for the " Natural's" . The taste is too good !!! Almost I had tried all the flavors they had with them!!!!|positive
Rated Natural's is famous for there sitafal ice cream.. When me and family are around natural's than we have the sitafal flavour only.. Natural's is the best|positive
Rated The taste of natural ice cream has gone down a lot :-( It leaves milk taste in mouth And comparatively other Indian new creams are good.. It's good for once a while|positive
Rated Natural's Ice-cream…Mouthwatering, isn't it??? I've been going to natural's since time immemorial…i seriously don't remember how long it has been, since childhood it's my favourite ice-cream spot… Natural's is a brand already and yes from my personal experience I can tell that you can expect the same 'quality ice-cream' and 'natural taste' whether you go to any of it's outlet's. Talking about it's Bhandup Outlet… The location is good, it's not very big, but still in that space, they provide seating, air condition and quick service. The staff is very good and welcoming. I am very well acquainted with them all. After the nirmal lifestyle's outlet got shut, this one is my fav spot especially in summer's. Even when we go out for dinner, we have ice-cream from natural's on our way back home. Though i'm very choosy about what I eat, I have tried almost all the flavours available here and trust me you will also love them all. My favourite is strawberry, which is a seasonal flavour (ah! I have to wait alot for it) sitafal, mango, tender coconut etc are very famous. They also provide with fruit pieces as topping on ice-cream (extra charges) If you cannot decide between two flavours and also don't wanna order for a double scoop, don't worry, they offer an option of choosing any two different flavours in a single scoop (NO extra charges). I generally order for anjeer and roasted almond mix. So what are you waiting for…? Just go, order one and experience the naturally good taste.|positive
Rated Its a brand name already! Well, i have tried almost allllllll the ice cream flavors out here. It is most famous for the Tender coconut flavor! And you GOTTA TRY it once in ur life. A mild and soothing flavor which is not too sweet. While the other flavors are also good enough; i didn't like mango flavored ice cream though.. didn't seem "natural" :-/|positive
Rated Naturals Ice Cream- My mouth starts watering after I hear this name. You'll almost find all seasonal fruit flavor ice cream and it is simply a wow feeling to have those seasonal ice creams at reasonable costs I have tried almost all the flavours and they all are very very yuummmmyyyyy....... The place is super clean and and the employees serving the ice cream wear head masks and gloves on hands and dats very great !!!! Always looking forward to go there ...........:)|positive
Rated It's a chilled out place to order from . Food is good . The quantities are also good enough for 2 ppl to eat properly . The service was quick and food got delivered well In time . Will definately order from here next time !|positive
Rated It is basically a take away outlet. They have good Chinese food. Good place to order if you are willing for a quick bite. Home delivery service is fast.|positive
Rated Good food at good price, curries are not traditionally on the heavy side and a must place though I ordered online through zomato so can't comment on restaurant.|positive
Rated It is just for delivery outlet which delivers tasty and yummy food from their big menu items. Just near by to my home. I usually order from here if there is nothing to eat at home and if I am very much hungry and want food to come home very fast then I call here. They usually close late but from few days they are closing early before 12. Kanjurites and bhandupites must try to order from here and taste the good food.|positive
Rated This place just accepts home delivery. Price is moderate and provide a variety of dishes in veg and non veg. But, (yes there is always a but) all the dishes have excess quantity of oil. The food is undoubtly tasty but you feel like you are drowning in oil and spice. I would like to recommend them to please reduce the amount of oil.|positive
Rated This takeaway branch of Cheftoon is nearby my brother's place. And we have ordered numerous times from them instead of they never stand on what we wanted or what they promised. But, there is not much option in Kanjurmarg and one find it really tough not to order sometimes. Yesterday, we ordered Singapore noodles and aloo ka parantha. First time, they come up with the less spicy and very near to what we ordered. Sigapore noodles were just right and as per our instructions. As usual, they messed up the Aloo ka parantha. They put a lot of red chilly powder in the filling and it was spicy to the core and I had to throe it away. Delivery: They are really fast in this and were at our doorstep in less than 20 minutes of order. Appreciate this.|positive
Rated Have been ordering at work from this place for quite a while now. And they definitely must be appreciated for delivering right up to Thane well before the given time. The food is always fresh and warm when it arrives and the packing also is much better than others who deliver around. Their chicken biryani is my favourite. Also the vegetarian counterpart is worth having. The butter chicken though wasn't as great. I have certainly had better at other places. Also the veg seekh kebabs lacked right amount of spice. But this place deserves a thumbs up for its biryani!|positive
Rated We order from cheftoon quiet a lot.. the food used to be pretty decent. . I personally liked the chicken crispy a lot.. now u hv to search for chicken in the crispy.. itz just flour which is fried n tossed in masala with too much of colour.|positive
Rated I loved there strategy of serving online .. I ordered online via food ordering app.. They serve good food.. Tasty is good and quality is also good|positive
Rated They prepare awesome food.. Love their every dish.. A boon in kanjur and bhandup where eating options are very limited.. Delivery timelines are quick aswell...|positive
Rated Ordered food at 9pm , its 10.57 now and food isnt here yet. Called the hotel three times after ordering the food with each time the receptionist sweetly lying that the food has left. Actually the food is kind of good, but such kind of customer satisfaction is not acceptable. Definitely not ordering from here again.|positive
Rated Its a place where you can get the best service.. It was a WoW experience... today.. Must visit.. once. Food, ambience, service everything�?|positive
Rated Had no expectations when coming here. It was not planned and it was like as if we didn't have any choice. The place itself doesn't give you much hope and then we ordered the normal stuff.. Chicken Biriyani Boneless and Shezwan Tripple Fried Rice. It was enough for the three of us. But believe me, it was lovely. The dishes tasted amazing. And its not just me, all three of us liked it equally. It was an unplanned, unexpected wonderful experience.|positive
Rated I have tried almost all the food available here. the chicken sandwich is awesome.. mix veg kolhapuri. grill sandwich. fried rice... all the dishes are up to the mark with perfect texture colour and taste..... I always visit here with my family perfect for family and get together|positive
Rated I have ordered more than 30 times(home delivery) and never gone wrong. Always delivered food on time. Chinese dishes are the one which are the best, however u can try some combos like lolipop with rice and many more.|positive
Rated I usually have my non veg food delivered home from here. The delivery is really quick i.e within 15 to 20 min. The food is very good and cheap. Also the food delivered is packed properly.|positive
Rated I know a lot of people seem not to like this place and give it a rating that's below the belt. But in my opinion, it delivers bang for buck. They don't pretend to be a fine-dine, and don't make food like one either. The food's pretty local and pretty cheap. I've tried their Chicken Biryani, the Chicken Masala, their Triple Schezwan Fried Rice, Dal Fry, Alu Jeera, and Butter Naans. The only gripe I have is that the naans are a bit chewy. Other than that, I'm pretty damned happy with the place. And also glad that they serve non-vegetarian food now. Try it, but know that you're not getting into a place that promises velvety textures and soothing aromas on their menu.|positive
Rated Shagun is a small space in Bhandup(W) offering the regular North Indian/Chinese fare. We ordered chicken Manchow soup for starters, Mix Hakka Noodles and a Chicken Triple Schezwan Rice. So we basically ordered the regular stuff. How hard can that be? Well the food was average and mostly sub-par. When I order a Manchow soup, I expect a beautiful umami flavor of the soy sauce. Strong hit of garlic, burst of spice from the minced green chilli, a feathery texture from the egg white and nice chewy texture of the chicken breast. The Soup here had too much of ginger garlic flavor and very less of the soya sauce making the dish somewhere between a shorba and a Manchow soup. The cut of the chicken breast was too long for a soup. The chef I guess used the same cut of chicken for both the soup and the noodles/fried rice. That approach towards food is lax and for me that's disappointing. The Mix Hakka Noodles delivered as expected. The noodles was nice soft and cooked to perfection. The crunchy texture of the bell peppers, cabbage and spring onions went great with the soft texture of the noodles. The chicken was cooked nice. All in all a good dish. The biggest disappointment in my order was the chicken triple Schezwan rice. It tasted weird. The rice had a pasty texture and the flavor was somewhere between weird and spoilt, more towards the weird though. We could not even eat more than a spoonful. I would go with 2 out of 5 for Shagun. This was a less value for money place considering that the food was very cheap.|positive
Rated Ordered from here when it 1st started. Firstly this place was a pure veg restaurant and suddenly after a month or so they started serving non veg too. Weird. The paneer tikka masala was good and so was the kulchas. Never ordered again after it changed.|positive
Rated One of the old restaurant of Bhandup which was opened when Station Plaza started. Back then this was my first restaurant where i tried multiple variety of Dosa and uttapam.Other then South Indian they offer north indian chinese and few of the continental dishes. I would say a pocket friendly restaurant with multiple option and good food .|positive
Rated If you want to a find a budget friendly, only vegetarian dishes serving place, then Bageecha is your answer. It serves decent food, I won't say out of the world taste or something, but you can get along. The restaurant has been around for many years now. Like for a really very long time. So one could say the over the years, it has lost its charm. It used to be a really well made food serving restaurant at a point of time. One could choose to go for the Non AC section only during the not so hot weather, else one would find, being seated in a sauna. The AC section thankfully is maintained well. The serving staff is just OK, in that perspective, as I said its simple restaurant managed by a team from south of India. In other words its a south Indian restaurant specialising in other cuisines also. Out with friends or family, can definitely give a shot for this place.|positive
Rated One of the good place to visit with the family The service is really good ..no matter how much crowdy the hotel becomes they really go for everyone !!!!!!|positive
Rated Nice ambience...3.0/5 But chairs are not in good condition.. One can find seat and the seat holder separated...a risky experience! Good food... 3.0/5 Ordered noodles but they were not so great...but biryani was excellent! Even paneer starter was soft and crips..good taste.! Service.. 2.5/5 Service was okay! Staff was in great hurry in everything except while taking serving orders.! No one to greet..hardly pay attention to d needs of customers! Not a bad experience overall... Food tasted good that saved our dinner!!|positive
Rated This is a quick fix option for me when i am really hungry and need to satisfy my food cravings. Okayish pav bhaji and greasy chinese food options but great varieties of dosas and wada sambhar.. A recommended dish is Paneer 65 which goes great with naan or fried rice.. also do try out their spring rolls, idli nd paneer crispy and faloodas Their prices keep on increasing day by day.. guess the proximity to station really works to their advantage|positive
Rated Pretty decent restaurant. There are 2 sections AC and non AC . If you want to have a quick bite and you are near bhandup station this is probably a hygienic option to go. I have been a here a couple of times. Paav bhajji, south Indian food is decent enough. Nothing fancy.|positive
Rated I had been here 1st time. It was around 11 and I was looking for dinner place. At this time you will find very few places to eat near Bhandup station, Bageecha is one of them. Typical Mumbai restaurant. They have AC and Non AC sections. I was alone so I preferred the non AC one. It was decent and clean. I ordered one pav bhaji, which was ohk in taste. Here they serve roasted papad with pav bhaji which was quite uniqe combination. But papad wasn't so good. Then I ordered chaas which was better. Overall a typical Mumbai restaurant but if you are nearby Bhandup station west and looking for some quick veg food then this place you can try. AC section was quite pleasant. May be I will try there next time.|positive
Rated I've been visiting this place over a decade… The quality of food has degraded over time.. There are many more better options available nearby, so it's been long, almost a year that I visited this place…Still we order food sometimes for home delivery. Ambiance- 3.5/5 (AC/NON-AC) Service- 3.5/5 Food- 3/5 Cuisine- Indian, Chinese, Fast Food. Once upon a time I used to love bageecha's pav-bhaji…Anyways you can still have a quick bite here, fast food & south indian is good. North Indian food is okay, never order naan ( u'l feel like you r chewing rubber) paneer butter masala is also good. I still like Bageecha's Hyderabadi Biryani & American Choupsey Dosa. Soups are totally unpredictable…I frequently order schezwan fried rice& mushroom manchurian gravy which also is 3/5..(sometimes the covering is too thick, dry ones are better) So overall you can still give it a chance & test your luck… All the best :)|positive
Rated Not just a juice centre but great fast food joint for Italian, Mexican or sandwiches. Great variety and quality of food. Small place but great service and value for money!!|positive
Rated Good food with good service. And above all an honest man serving it with his honest suggestions. Not a single thg we ordered was below avg. Every single dish was good. Esp pahadi garlic bread. Wld def visit again. Thanks Mehul bhai.|positive
Rated Bliss juice centre is small outlet at mahavir nagar which serves different kinds of yummy and mouthwatering juices, milkshakes and mocktails. It also serves delicious and tasty sandwiches, pizzas n many more. Overall its good place for foodies.|positive
Rated Pretty nice place. They have a greay variety of sandwiches and juices. The exotic grills are a must try. Its a normal roadside shop. But dont go by the looks, you'll surely repent.|positive
Rated Amazing food... Garlic bread nd strawberry cream MUST try,,, never had such delicious garlic break ever... Great experience for foodies.. Definitely would like to visit again if I'm in kandivali|positive
Rated They serve some nice juices & milkshakes : particularly liked the Purple Litchi (Kala Jmaun & Litchi ) & the Mango Sitaphal Malai Milkshake was really creamy & tasty. The Pahadi Garlic bread is also worth trying. Pizza was also tasty. Give the Pasta a miss. Its a small outlet, where you may have to be seated in a cramped fashion but when with a gang of friends out for a late night weekend binge, it doesn't matter|positive
Rated If you are really kind of bored eating those regular street side food in Mahavir nagar, this is the place you should visit. A small place in mahavir nagar with few amazing bread items and juices. It gives you a vast variety of choices with amazing personalised service. Must try here is Pahadi Grill, Garlic Bread, summer cooler, and those cheesy rolls. Schezwan sauce here tht without addition of color. Worth a try!|positive
Rated While people now a days are judging a hotel mostly on their decor, this is an example where your decision on decor would lead to regret. Though this place is small and does not offer good ambience but one thing that it definitely offers is it's delicious food. All different combinations of juices are available and they are definitely worth trying. The sandwiches and garlic bread are also awesome. The staff is very friendly and it can be seen that they serve with love. It is a must try for juices.|positive
Rated With almost all the places in mahavir nagar offering the same menu with few things here and there,the quality of the food differentiates them from one another. Bliss Juice is a small road side seating eatery shop that offers you the widest varieties in terms of bread as well as juice items.With wooden tables and plastic tables,this place is neat and comfortable and less noise of the moving traffic as compared to on the 90 feet road. Though it took them more time to prepare but the sandwich justified everything.It was made in a toaster and perfectly cut into 4 square pieces with grated cheese on the top served along with spicy green chutney and garlic chutney.The aloo masala inside the sandwich was hot which clearly showed that it was given enough time to toast and not prepared quickly by spreading butter on the top.With finely chopped onions and capsicums in it,the sandwich tasted delicious.The garlic chutney was extra bonus which had a little tangy and garlicky taste in it. The Watermelon Juice was asked to serve without ice and sugar.The good thing about the juice was it was served in a long juice glass.The quantity was excellent for Rs.50.Without sugar in it ,it was pure in taste and had round watermelon balls in it. Will come and try pizzas and other juice combo.I hope this place lasts long into the future and proves to be a blissful location for the localities. Recommended :)|positive
Rated Too good drinks n food must try corn pahadi sandwich, strawberry milkshake and do not forget to have hot sizzling brownie everything is easy on pocket and definitely worth|positive
Rated Even if I am about to burst..if someone offers me to have some dessert specially malai kulfi or rabdi or jalebi rabdi and even better malai rabdi shake.. I can have 2 servings .. But I won't say the same in other desserts.. The sweet and savoury taste malai kulfi is one of my weakness .. I really think that they can make this place better in the sense of presentation.. Or else for taste - 4.2/5|positive
Rated Have tried their plain rabdi and dint like it as Much as I love the rabdi at other places. The concept of rabdi shake sounds exciting so am waiting to give that a shot!|positive
Rated Rabdi wala - very good place to hangout. A friend of mine suggested me and i really didn't regret visiting this place.. I and my wife had mango & laccha rabdi which was great. Would like to visit there again with my whole family.|positive
Rated Complete desi stuff beating all Rajasthani restaurants ......dal baati churma, bajra no rotlo and at the end hot jalebi with rabdi. Small but excellent place and reasonably priced|positive
Rated One of the finest places for vegetarians especially thalis.....man being a meat lover tried this place and it was just filling and tempting for any veg cravings you get....so a must try atleast one time!!|positive
Rated 12th Feb, 2016 Summary: One of those tiny regional eateries that you find after years by chance or word of mouth, specialising in different flavours of Rabdi, some Rajasthani & Kathiawadi dishes. Please Please don't you come here from far town (like me) to eat pav bhaji or chaat. The regional menu is a gem so stick to it. Pricing is high given the one man portion size. Our team regional cuisine night hosted by our latest two joiners. We drive from Goregaon & reach Rabdiwala in Borivali by quarter past seven. The eatery has frugal cane bench seating placed on the footpath, bamboo tables, seats with some colourful Rajasthani cushions & mirrorwork wallpaper on the walls behind us. A open live station is next to us with a huge vessel of hot ghee soaked batti & another huge frying pan with sugar syrup golden tiny jalebis. A stack of the traditional sweet GHEVAR stares back at me. Our first group who reached earlier are having masala papad, Angoori Rabdi with jalebi (8.5/10) , kachori chat. Me and my table group order the famous Dal Batti Churma, the supervisor recommends it to be crushed when served to us. Two plates of crushed Batti, sweet powdery Churma, green chilly (9/10), sweet chutney & a mint spicy chutney, diced onion & a glass of thick creamy chaats (10/10). A perfect meal for one. Ghee soaked batti is dunked with the dal (9/10) , some onion & I mix the Churma too. Crunchy , sweet, spicy , oily ..a 10/10 for me. We then order the thali with bajra rotla (9/10), baingan Bartha (9/10) & gatte ki subzi (9/10). All perfect to eat between me & my two lady colleagues. The buttermilk is so thick and creamy with just the right masala. The gulkand Rabdi is the best (10/10), with flower petals sprinkled on top. The hot spongy G'jams are soaked in syrup, too sweet but nice (9/10). The Sitaphal Rabdi (8/10) is not too creamy, but perfect for those who like less sugar. We are given a complimentary plate of hot crisp jalebis (9.5/10). I finish most of it thanking the supervisor for his hospitality. The guys order another Dahi chaat and plain Rabdi. We are satiated by an hour, as we leave The older table staff tells me the place is getting renovated & hence the outside seating is messy. Bhaiyo..it's ok. The food speaks for itself here & I hope to come next time singing the PK song "TharKi Chokro Aayo re Banke Mharo Mehmaan" !!!!|positive
Rated Rabdiwala does a marvellous job at making your taste buds explode with joy at every bite! They beat the long known famous chains like Rajdhani hands down! Located near Mc Donalds, Borivali, Rabdiwala is a small joint...... Their seating arrangement is that of traditional Rajasthani feel with canewood tables and kathiawadi seats..... ...

Rated I am sceptic when it comes to the authenticity of the food I eat. Have heard raving reviews of this place and let me assure you; this place lives up to its reputation. A perfect road side joint serving amazing Rajasthani cousine. First in was Dalbaati Churma – contrary to my skepticism, the Baati was SOFT; let me repeat Baati was SOFT. It’s quite rare to bite into Baati which is this soft. The first mouthful reveals the secret to the softness – hours of soaking the Baati in Ghee. The entire plate is served with condiments – Sweet MooghDal halwah, pudina chutney and sweet-hot red chutney. Every mouthful with a pinch of these condiments individually reveals a different taste. Then came is the Thepla with Aalu shubzi – Thepla made fresh and served hot, driping of oil, loaded with sesame seeds. Aalu diced, cooked to perfection with spices and masala. It was a pleasure to devour this combination. The best part – you can taste the masala, ghee without the heat of chilly - Absolute perfection. Then it was time to satisfy the sweet tooth. Hot gulabjamoon with cold rabdi – as the first spoonful of rabdi rolls over the tongue, one can feel the thickened milk and the layers of milk cream. The process of thickening the milk then sweetening it done with love and care. The milk cream is absolute perfection smooth like silk with no lumps. As the rabdi rolls down the throught there is the left over taste of sweetness with a ting of rose water flavor then will force you to take the next spoonful of rabdi. The gulabjamoon was beautifully prepared, soft, properly soaked in warm sugar syrup and no lumps at the center.|positive
Rated Thandai this is what we ordered for my office holi celebration and was bit hesitate to order from this place as it was totally new for me to order for 100 pax . But rabdiwala did a brilliant job in making thandai . Thandai was full of pista badam n lot more . Quality of milk used was up to the mark Thank you rabdiwala n team for making our holi event more colourful|positive
Rated Nice place. Tried it with a few friends. We had pani puri to start with. Which was decent, however the water needed to be chilled for better taste. Once we were seated, we ordered couple of the thalis,all the vegetables were good. Special mention for the gatte ka sabji and papad ka sabji! The dal khichdi was excellent too!! The deserts were literally the icing on the cake! Moong dal halwa as outstanding! Overall a very good experience. Will surely go back to try more stuff!!|positive
Rated The Real One hits all the right notes. This little cubby hole of a home kitchen makes the best burgers in the city of Mumbai/Bombay. For a start, buffalo (beef) and pork and a blend of both are on their menu. You cannot take a burger place seriously unless it makes pork and beef patties. The surfeit of chicken burgers in the city have diluted the sensibility of what a great Hamburger should be. The burgers at the Real One are not pre-processed. They're freshly minced and hand-made. You can choose your toppings - the egg and cheese are great choices, but I prefer the virgin option - burger on a bun sans anything. If you're on a ketogenic diet, just wolf down the patties. It is astonishing to find such quality in a quiet part of the city, but in a culture where people are more interested in the ostentatious than the simple, I can see why The Real One would be overlooked.|positive
Rated I had been to this place a few days back. After hearing my frnds talk about this place for quite sometym, finally got to visit this place. The order is taken in a different style. U plave your order and then choose whether u wanna sit in the backyard of the house and eat or take away. I chose to eat in the backyard. A small place with an average set up. I would love to have my food there. Anyways going with the food talk. We ordered for 3 burgers: Pigs can fly. This burger is really good. The Patty is what I like. The buns are average size. The burger was well made not too many sauces put in. Just the juicy patty to taste. Pulled pork braised. This burger wont be liked by all but all in all good to my taste. The classic dream burger. This burger had a combination of a pork and beef patty which was new to me. The patty was nice and not dry. It tasted really well. All the burgers wer above average. They didn't fill me in one. There were no sides to any. But the best thing is, it takes them not more than 10-15 mins to prepare the burger. They have an option of caramelized onion add on. I think they should just add that to the burger directly would be better and juicier. But I think this place has one of the best burger patties I have eaten. Food 4.5 Service 3.5 Ambience 3.5 With Alfred Johnson and Liston Mascarenhas|positive
Rated It's not a proper restaurant I would say. You can sit and have your meal in the backyard where there are a couple of tables. It is managed by just one guy with little help so that's the reason why it's open for such limited amount of time. It's wonderful service to us. The ambience:- Depends on who you ask ? :-P Read the introduction . The Food :- Well I'm short of words I genuinely was so so pleased and delighted to have those juicy and succulent burgers they have. One of the best ones I have ever had ! Beer braised pulled pork burger with bacon add-on it is proper indulgence if you're a health freak let it go for one evening and have this without any guilt. Chicken chilly burger does justice to the name it's quite spicy. All in all both the things were quite good I loved it can't wait to go again. These two burgers are more than enough you fill your tummy. I hope they would also have some sides. I would like to have a some fries , chips etc . Vegetarian people as far as I know there isn't anything for you except for the aerated drinks . Non-vegetarian people if you haven't tried this place I would recommend you try this place out it's worth it . Note :- I couldn't find any board signifying the place so find the red door or just ask the friendly locals. Cheers. Thank you for reading. PS :- Will update the review when I try the others burgers|positive
Rated I had told you'll the one point is missing just because the delivery is not at all available for the near by resident.....rest these burgers just make you fall in love and if the delivery starts your phone won't stop ringing 😘😘|positive
Rated This is a joint established in a residential bungalow in Borivali west known for its great burgers. I tried it one evening and felt satisfied with just some minor let downs. It is a place inside a house operated by very friendly people. There is very basic seating is in the backyard where you can enjoy your food in a very homely and peaceful environment. I ordered a pulled pork burger and a pulled beef, which was technically a buff burger. It arrived without much delay but presentation is an issue here with no sides. Some wafers or fries could have done something really substantial to its overall visual as well as completion value in itself. The meats were really good with great texture but the flavors were a bit towards average. Over that the bun was a major spoiler doing injustice to the great work done inbetween. A little improvement in quality of bun and presentation value can make this place one of the best burger serving places in mumbai. Still the prices are on lower side so nothing much can be expected but it is indeed doable. My Rating: 1. Food: 3.75/5 2. Service: 4/5 3. Ambiance: 3.5/5 4. Value of Money: 4/5 neverknowsbest.in|positive
Rated As the name says, this is the real one place to visit, hell of choice to choose from. The burgers are absolutely a treat and way better than Mc Donalds and burger king. Grilled chicken/pork, dream beef and beer braised pulled pork are a must try. Definitely a place worth visiting any time.|positive
Rated The burgers are quite cost effective!! No1 can match their price band! Tried Spicy Chicken & Pulled Pork out of which I found Pork one better .. but the major drawback was the bun..😫which not fresh .. they definitely need to work on that. Also no siders😑 .. In no case can one have a burger without fries/chips/drinks(at least soft drinks�?) Lastly der are lot of mosquitoes in the evening|positive
Rated Situated in a bunglow in the heart of the colony, The Real One sells some mouth watering burgers. Currently, there are a few other joints too among the ones who sell "actual burgers", unlike the one's at MCD or BK; The Real One being one of them. I tried the pulled beef and also the pork burger. Both were equally good in their own style. Although, my taste is for the beef burger. The meat was rightly cooked with just the right amount of greens in it. It is sure worth the price on the burger. The service is fast and their communication is clear to their customers. Although other than serving you your burger you would not receive any more assistance as there is never a steward at sight. When it comes to the ambience; sitting in someone's backyard and having some good burgers may feel a bit awkward. It would be better if the seating area is created with a more comfortable atmosphere. But! If burgers is all that matters, you should be heading here.|positive
Rated Been here a number of times and tried quite a few burgers here! So its out of experience I can say that his burgers are out there at the front and are among the better burgers I have eaten! The grilled chicken, herbed chicken, spicy chicken , spicy pork, grilled pork are all just great! The spicy pork appealed to me in particular as it had a few goan n manglorean flavours coming through it! The meat in the patty, or in the case of some burgers, the meat itself, was very tender n cooked to perfection which just kept pulling me back here! In my opinion, it would have been a 4.5 rating easily, but if you deny burgers to a foodie for half the week, well you lose half a point in the rating!|positive
Rated These little burger joints scattered all across the city are really becoming my weak points. Another one of those meatilicious burger joints. The place is open only 3 days of the week, so when you plan to visit the place, make sure its a working day. The venture is home based, so quality is as good as it can get. But to my surprise the burgers are priced at dirt cheap rates. I haven't seen burgers of this quality being served at such a price. It is advisable to take a parcel home but if you fancy enjoying your meat as if you are having a backyard party then you have that option as well. We tried spicy chicken burger, beef and pork and my all time favourite pulled pork. Spicy chicken burger stays true to it's name and is firey. Beef and pork mixed burger was probably a little on dry side for my liking. And as I said, my all time favourite, pulled pork didn't disappoint me as always. It was by far the best of the lot. The service is really nice and quick. Also the menu provides a horizon of options to choose from, so be ready to be spoilt for choices!|positive
Rated Pizzas are very yummy.. Its good.. Well budgeted.. Short sweet resto /house... Friendly atmosphere.. Quality and quantity is nice... Its really good place to eat netym..|positive
Rated The big 24 inch pizza was awesome .I came along with my friends, after a friend recommend ed it..loved it! Also the garlic bread was good . the place is very small . Telling them beforehand is a must to avoid waiting. Good alternative to Dominoes and pizza hut!|positive
Rated Cheesy Garlic Bread was Yummy, Good Quality of Cheese they use, and Verity of slices Pizza, Also Good for single person for mini Pet Pooja, any time when you feel little Hungry,.....|positive
Rated This place is very easy to locate, exactly opposite Bhagwati hotel. They have very limited sitting space, something that they could work on. Coming to the food here. I am a huge fan of the garlic breads. I mean it is like those typical food videos that are viral on social media these days! Very cheesy, cheese is filled inside and on top of it too. The shape is not like the typical garlic bread. Pizzas are good too. The cheese doesn't get chewy even after eating it cold. The best part, their oregano is not the only dry flakes. It is like the dominos, salt and other spices.|positive
Rated A quite nice place to have some changes taste to try other than Domino's ans pizza hut. The same prise here and there but gives good relief to our taste burds|positive
Rated We decided to have a pizza but wanted a break from the normal Dominos. Ta -da. Look up zomato and we come across this place! We ordered a cheese pizza with extra sauce and cheese. Such a huge pizzzaaaaaaa! Like they can give competition to any pizzerias! They manage it to deliver the huge pizza perfectly in one piece. It's cheaper than the "Famous" pizza joints. And it's 24 inch pizza is perfect when you have friends coming over for night outs and movies. The sauce is amazing. Like definitely my favourite! Must try!|positive
Rated Small outlet in charkop which offers yummy food! They serve delicious garlic bread and pizza slices with variety of options! Free wifi and good service are some the plus points of this restaurant!|positive
Rated Greetings! All foodies please take note of this Pizza heaven. Pizzaria Houses' kickass pizzas knock out any competition. Fresh, handmade and generous-on-toppings pizzas are miles ahead of the industrious Dominos and Pizza Hut. My first 5.0 rating and it completely deserves so. Location: Pizzaria House is near the busy crossroad of Charkop Market in Kandivali. This makes it easily spottable. For those not familiar with the area, its bang opposite the well known Bhagwati Restaurant. Ambiance: Decent. The place is small. 5 tables for 2 to be exact. The counter is besides the sitting and one can even peek into the kitchen. The walls are decorated with pictures of tempting pizzas and sandwiches. Lighting is fine, furniture is decent and hygiene is maintained. If you are a group of 4 or more, reservation is recommended. Food: One word "Divine". All pizzas are delicious. Their Cheese Burst is literally flooded with liquid cheese. The 12 inch triangle slice is a unique style for selling pizzas. Other sizes available are 14, 16 and 24 inches, all complete circles (24 inch one is a monster, serving atleast 8 hungry souls). The pizza base is freshly rolled and all ingredients used are premium quality. Toppings are generous, even cheese. I've also tried their cheese garlic bread which is little unorthodox, but tastes yum. Other items yet to be consumed :p Service: Very good. The staff is very freindly. They give you enough time to decide your order and help you by explaining their dishes. Becsuse of their unorthodox pizza sizes, this help is really useful. I've been here on Christmas night and had to wait only about 20-25 minutes for my order. Satisfied. Cost: Very well priced for the quality and quantity. Offers and discounts make it that much more economical. The 12" triangles and Cheese Bursts are paisa-vasool. Delivery: Slightly slow on weekend primetimes due to staff limitations. However food is delivered piping hot even if its a little late. Recommendations: Obviously, you gotta try the Cheese Burst. Among others, Paneer Throttle is my favourite. Cheese Garlic Bread, Stom Roll and Chocolate Sandwich are worth trying dishes. Overall, a huge MUST TRY for all pizza lovers. There is a very good chance that it might turn out to be the best pizza you ever had. If you find this review useful, hit like. And check out the tempting pizza pics which I've shared earlier. To the Management: Please try to bring more varieties for the Cheese Burst. Cheese Burst 12" Triangle Pizzas would be perfect additions to your menu. Very happy with your food and service.|positive
Rated Here is a Pizzeria that is serving completely unorthodox pizzas.... Their menu includes a 12-inch long pizza slice (which is pretty wide in size as well), a 14-inch pizza, a 16-inch pizza and a 24-inch pizza.... So basically if you wanna have a pizza party but your friends are big gluttons, this is a place you can get the perfect size for your gluttony friends. As for flavours and tastes, the pizzas are really good and even a 12-inch slice is pretty much stomach filling. I also tried an Aloo Tikki Burger which was good too.... So over all, a nice pizza place for people with big appetite.....|positive
Rated Serves awsm pizza n burgers... Small place, service wasn't quick but the best part was food... Tried Vaishnav pizza n cheese burger... Burger was mind blowing :)|positive
Rated If you want to display your culinary skills and you know nothing, Egg comes to your rescue. If you are damn hungry and you want something quickly, Egg comes to your rescue. If there is an argument between a herbivore and carnivore, Egg comes to your rescue. That is enough to suggest I am an Eggetarian. And if you are one too, Rajubhai Bhurjiwala is the place to be. Ande ka Funda → 3.5/5 Visited this place long time back and tried a hell lot of stuffs. All my memories of this place were rejuvenated when i visited it once again. And the taste still remains the same → Egg-licious. ♥ Bhurji Pav -One of my favourite dish of all time. And this place doesnt disappoint. Served hot with some butter pav and chopped onions, its everything you want it to be. ♥ Gotala Pav - Out of curiosity, we tried Gotala. Though it was spicy (beware of the chillies), the creamy taste was a treat. Good option. A soft drink goes well with these delicacies. Ambience → NA Its a regular eatery and we should be thankful that they have provided some seating area. But to our dismay, its always full. Service → 3/5 Its fast. Just what you want. If you feel hungry after 7 pm, this place will surely make you happy (cost wise too). Enjoy !|positive
Rated Small place large price. Good to hat he has variety. Happy he is near to my place. Happy to visit him again with one of my favorite person Chinika Prabhu|positive
Rated If you are hardcore Eggetarian then you must must visit Rajubhai burji wala in Boriwali west !! I just wish it this place could be near by my vicinity but for me it was special visit to explore this lovely place for streetfood taste. Egg dishes like omlet & boil egg to max burji is too common but here menu card is loaded dishes really with creativity! Although I haven't tried all of them but surely in my comming visits I'm sure I won't dare to skip any single one from it. Place is very small still he has manage to set up but dining area - a table with few sitting tables. There was one guy who was making other one who was looking after service. Good rapo between them! They have two options whether you want in oil or butter. I'm very layman & prefer always oil made omelet :P but if you will observe butter dishes are truly overpriced ! That's other point that it's still pocket friendly price 😘 egg boil were in Indian style! Which I call over done since I like little liquid but runny 😬|positive
Rated One of the oldest bhurji guys. He used to sit just right outside on a bakda as we call it before shifting to some other place and back again here with his shop. Welcome yourself to the delight of spicy and mouth watering egg varieties. Makes it real good and spicy.. His gotala is to die for! 😋 Grab a quick bite and fill your stomach with very little to shed from your pockets.|positive
Rated The place is heaven for egg lovers Had been there on 14th Nov 2015 Had ordered 1.Egg omelette dosa : 9. 5 on 10 Served with pav, onion n spicy chatni 2. Australian Fry :8 on 10 3. Green ghotala: 9 on 10 The place is a small place... But has a offering to please every egg lover|positive
Rated Did the chicken come first or the egg? While we (the human race) still do not have a conclusive answer to this question, we do have immense love and need to consume both and we have one of the finest joints for egg dishes in this part of the city. Operated out of a shop on Shimpoli Road, Rajubhai has a few stools and a table outside the shop and that is all the ambiance you will get here, so don't be uptight and crib about it if you do happen to go there. While takeaway would be the best option to follow, people do flock out there on weekends in their cars et al and have a sort of dine-in on weekends. The place opens up only after 7 in the evening unfortunately, so the eggs cannot be enjoyed in the daylight. Owing to my craving for eggs during the Navratri season (as does happens every year), we made our way to this place. Sitting on small plastic stools, we were presented the menu by the help staff. On it was a long list of names of dishes inspired by the Indian versions of three classic egg dishes - Omlette, Half Fry and Scrambled Eggs. Dishes ranging from Bhurji to Gotala and peculiar dishes like Anda Paplet, Omlette Dosa and Boil Anda Sabzi. We ordered the Egg Bhurji, Boil Anda Kheema, Green Gotala and Omlette Dosa. Each of the dishes were heavy on fat, spices and overall level of tastiness. The Bhurji was different and better than those available on roadside stalls or even at the South Mumbai Irani Cafes. The Boil Anda Kheema was a revelation and stands out to be one of the best used dish of boiled eggs. The basic gist of preparation is making a bhurji out of boiled eggs, but turns out to be much tastier than it sounds. The base ingredients of the Green Gotala were not very clear to me, but from what I tasted, it seemed like spinach and coriander were fused with a normal Gotala and the result was delicious. Taking pole position alongside the Boiled Kheema was the lip smacking Omlette Dosa. Not only did it look and smell inviting, it had us salivating by the time we tore into it. The concept of the dish is to stuff an omlette with some vegetables and an overload of his masala mixture. For all the omlette lovers out there, this one is not to be missed. A slight warning for those who are not too fond of the overuse of spices and masalas, the dishes here tend to be overwhelming in terms of masalas and might prove slightly hot for your internal systems. Apart from that, a simple and top-notch place for Egg variants in Borivali. Revisits are a certainty. REPORT CARD: Quality Of Food: 4/5 Taste: 5/5 Ambiance: NA Quality Of Service: 3/5 Value For Money: 4/5 Overall: 4.5/5.|positive
Rated Yes it is a restaurant in a very small shop. But rajubhai manages to have a big time awesome business here. This place is a speciality for delicacies made up of eggs.. Superb taste People here wait and have patience here chill a bit and have their food when their turn comes but you can still order #boiled egg kanada daalke. This place is surely a big time hit And if you believe in the quote "Sunday ho ya monday, roz khaao ande, Then this place should be saved on your GPS for sure.|positive
Rated Egg paradise.. Bhurjee, omelets, egg dosa, everything is good... No problem with Hygiene... Order processing is fast too... Just the a thing needed here is proper ventilation...|positive
Rated Beginning I decided to visit this outlet cause it had a really high rating plus the prices of their product seemed cheaper than normally expected of a good outlet. It's another one of those shops that are located in deep end of IC Colony, it located on holy cross road which is around 3 km away from the tail end of borivali station. It's located on the opposite side of the Holy Cross Road Food Court. --------------------- Appearance It's a decent sized outlet with all their products on display at the front. The shop has a okay look nothing really stands out except for the two large ovens used to heat up any products that meant to be served immediately. --------------------- Service & Preparation Speed This place is managed by a older gentleman who mostly handles the transaction of the money & other two men who mostly take the order & handle the packaging of products. Overall the service was okay nothing to special to speak of. Sadly their packaging is bad & if multiple products are present in one box, even with a slight tumble can make them crash into each other. --------------------- Food Food for the most part of really good in some parts & a bit disappointing in others. One of the benefits of buying products from here is it's really cheap & the quality is above of what is expected of a shop selling cheap products. I had ordered the Chicken Samosa, Roast Lamb Sandwich, Chicken Lollipop, Chocolate Doughnut, Chocolate & Lemon Tart, Bread Pudding & Choco Lava cake. There was no one product that was really outstanding. The Chicken Samosa was just really good & I wanted to savor it's taste but sadly it was just bite size & finished easily which was really sad. The Chocolate Doughnut & the Lava Cake were the better ones of their products nothing worth to nitpick about, good texture & taste. The Chocolate & Lemon Tart had a good taste but the base tart up to some extent crumbled. The Roast Lamb Sandwich was decent, it was just the basic mayonnaise with small pieces of lamb & the bread with its crust cut off. Their Chicken Lollipop had a decent taste & before tasting it I was surprised by the size & also had a doubt that it had access refined flour as a coating. Bread Pudding had a decent texture but the taste was disappointing, the elaichi taste was overwhelming & also combined with it was a tooti frooti like taste --------------------- Ending FINAL OUTPUT - Cafe Ceclida is a good outlet were you can visit with a low amount of cash, but still buy just a small immediate snack or a takeaway that can also be used as accompaniment with either lunch or dinner. The products did yield a bag of mix results some good some bad, though not so bad that it would be a complete disappointment.|positive
Rated The food here is just out of the world.....if want a snack just try anything and it will win your heart and tummy....thumbs up to this place.....just incredible :)|positive
Rated A popular place in IC colony! best in finger food that u would relish all day long,they offer a variety of puffs, biryani and lollipops. for the vegetarians they have some good sandwich that you would love to try. Highly recommended !|positive
Rated One of my friend suggested me to visit this cafe for its croissants.. Cheese croissant !!😘 The best thing at this place (for vegetarians) There are very few items for vegetarians. It has most of all non-veg items.|positive
Rated Amazing ! Tasty ! Fits your pocket food. We had a lollipop which had very very different flavour unlike the normal ones. Innovative thought of a chicken samosa. Kudos for that. Everything out there is worth a try !! Go grab a bite. Would prefer pick up the food warm it nicely at home and enjoy!|positive
Rated I visited this cafe with a friend on his recommendation & it was a real treat. It has a lot of varieties of food items including chicken samosa which I had never heard of or tasted in my life. I had a few items there & they were really nice. It's a fantastic place for the meat lovers to have a quick bite. I would recommended this place highly.|positive
Rated Situated in d heart of IC this place is a meat heaven. Though d bakery items sell off really fast and you may have limited options to choose from, whatever you get a hand off is guaranteed to be yummy. The only negative of dis bakery cum cafe is its seating. Very limited! Service wise its pretty homely and a must try out absolutely.|positive
Rated I had heard great things about this place from my friends and decided to check it out for myself. I visited at around 7:15 pm and most of the food was already over. I tried the pepper chicken croissant and the bread pudding and loved it. Delicious, quick bites and warm interiors. Would visit again, hopefully during the day! Philmon James|positive
Rated My all day go to place nearby for my all day food cravings. Service is quite polite and loads of variety to choose from. There can't really be a favorite because most of the stuff was pretty amazing. And also quite pocket friendly. Their Schezwan sauce is the thing that sets it apart from any other bakery around the area. A must visit place for all your cravings!|positive
Rated Nice place to enjoy the perfect breakfast.....the sandwich and croissant are awesome.....a piece of advice most of the time the crates are empty...so if one wants to enjoy reach early...or else u wont get one|positive
Rated One of the most popular cakes shops/bakery finally in Borivali. I was so happy that there is a Merwans in Borivali also now. Whenever you go here its always crowded. the place feels more like a market just like the Andheri branch. This place is more focused on the veg food rather than the non veg food. The variety of non veg is comparatively less. So i still like the Andheri Merwans better. Haven't tried any of the veg stuff here but the non veg is really good but still tastes a bit different for the other branch. I dont have to say much about its mava cakes so i won't even bother speaking about them. The pricing of the food is as usually very cheap, that and the quality of food is what makes it so famous. Ambience: 2.5 Food: 3.5 Service: 3.5 Pricing: 3.0|positive
Rated Have tried butterscotch cake n chocolate cake. It's a veg cake brand cheaper than the other HiFi brands but provides good quality n delicious cakes. Have been to the Andheri branch as well. Dats a better shop with good space, more number of products, puffs, pastries etc. Its so crowded n the stock gets over on weekends n occasions.|positive
Rated Their products are awesome! The cakes, pastries and patties are good. I personally love the Garlic Chicken Pattice. This Borivali outlet has some tables for dine in. Hence, I decided to grab a quick bite after collecting my parcel. I ordered for a Pattice. They did not give me a plate. I requested for a plate. THEY TELL ME THEY DON'T HAVE PAPER PLATES. I POINT OUT THE PLATES LYING AT THE BACK OF THE COUNTER TO HAND ME ONE. THEY REPLY I CANNOT. I insisted on having a paper plate after much arguing with even the manager does he hand me one plate like HE HAS DONE A FAVOUR TO ME. Not giving the essentials as service and having an area to dine in makes absolutely no sense. Maybe, you'll can improve your service to keep up the brand name.|positive
Rated A little bakery sees a lot of rush as people returning home head here for a quick bite. It's suggested to go before evening as by evening their stocks are all sold out, specially the savory items like the rolls, patties. Very good and cheap option for a quick bite.|positive
Rated Merwans used to be the 'Go To' cake shop in college days when it was someone's birthday in the group. I was very happy when it opened it's outlet in Borivali West. It is located at one of the busy places in Borivali and quite close to the station. The shop is quite spacious and smells of cake as you enter. Well if you are in two minds of picking up a cake or pastries from here, please be rest assured of the taste. They are nice tasting, fresh and creamy. Two of them I would really recommend are Butterscotch and Chocolate Truffle. It is also very famous for its Mawa Cup Cake. Do give it a try if you have not had one.|positive
Rated Merwans is especially known for its cake. Here food items are divided into 2 section both veg and non veg. Had Paneer patties which was good. Tried exquisite chocolate truffle which also was very good. And the mawa cake was too good.. At times lot of their stuffs get over early due to demand. This just tells how good it is. Overall a good experience.|positive
Rated It's Merwans... Ideally there is no need for a review here but let me write what others have already informed you. Best Pocket friendly Cakes Best Pocket friendly Pastries Awesome Chicken Puffs (Chicken Garlic & Thai) There is always crowd which tells you how good the place is. Perfect place to sit and enjoy some puffs or pastries.|positive
Rated One of the most frequented place by me and my friends. We gather here for chit chat, play some games like UNO, or marbles etc. Its fun. Ordered Gulkand Iced tea as my first order which was very okayish. The taste of gulkand was too much and felt more like a sharbat than iced tea. Second time, I ordered regular cold coffee. Coffee was good but quantity too less. The frothing itself took 1/4 portion of the glass leaving just 3-4 sips to gulp down!|positive
Rated V just passed by dis cafe, not a coffee lover , ordered masala cutting tea, nachos n spinach cheese sandwiches n bun maska to end wid, very cozy cute little cafe.... In dis cafe u can take long tea conversations n also play games like cards, bourvita scrabble etc.|positive
Rated Had passed this place zillion times & always wanted to give it a shot but dint get around doing so. During my month long break from work on a lazy evening I got my ass out of home and went to Tea Pea wid another avid foodie. With current trend of Tea Houses this place stands out as it had started much before the trend started. They have veryyyyyyy nice ambiance. A relaxing seating inside as well as outside. Bean bags are sprawlled outside. tiny lil things here & there to add jazz. Music is nice. They also have a mini library that has good books stacked up for all generes. Menu is quite interesting. Must Tries - Various types of teas. I have tried couple of them and they were pretty good. Coolers are good too.|positive
Rated One of the best places to go to actually do tp with your friends. Junglee Garlic Bread was what I had. It was much much good then what I had expected. The food was really awesome. And Cranberry Ice Tea is a must! Till today I always had Peach Ice Tea, but this, this totally changed my mind & my choices. Seating Arrangements is good. Service is good. And the best part is we can play games over there, like UNO & other card games. For more info, visit there!! 😉|positive
Rated Nice place to hangout with friends.U can play games like uno,scramble,X n 0,snakes and ladders while having sandwich or coffee.Food is not so good in taste.Average quality and quantity of food.|positive
Rated It's a pretty decent cafe and is a cool place to hangout with friends. You can grab a book and sit for hours having tea with biscuits, coffee, or the varied range of hot and cold drinks they offer along with something to munch. I sat for hours chatting with an old friend over chai. It's a nice change to all the clichéd versions of cafes around the city. The framed tea quotes makes the place more appealing to tea lovers.|positive
Rated It's a small hangout place which serves quite tasty snacks and lip smacking drinks ! Its USP is the freely available games - UNO , jenga , Scrabble etc and popular books. Easily spent a lazy afternoon with my friends. But it's not a posh place. And the AC section is very small. The manager was *extremely * rude to me when I asked him if he could accommodate us inside ( since there was no one else ) and told us to sit outside since he didn't want the "loyal " customers to sit outside in the heat. That totally bummed me out . The card machine didn't work. The roof leaked . So the ambience does not match with the prices on the menu. Rating it 3 for the food and the games.|positive
Rated Ginger tea.. Some snacks or cookiesss Cool friends.. Ludo..uno ahhh bliss ! To add on -WiFi (offered by them) I can spend whole day playing uno :p|positive
Rated After a long time i had started visiting places, and a frnd of mine suggested this place.... Tea pea, nice little place situated in borivali west near by hotel granville. This place is a nice combination of street style chai seller and a little western touch, Has 2 seating areas, indoors nd outdoors, outdoors is a smoking zone which i am not fond of, anyways, the tables and chairs at this place will give u a typical old house feeling and they have also taken the effort to keep board and card games for visitors to keep themselves entertained which i liked... Everything that they make is made my hand, nd not with help of any machine, so even if u get ur order late its worth it... I didnt have much food here, just pasta and cheese garlic bread Whch was delicious... The decor of the indoors is very soothing, a book shelf whch will definitely attracr readers, customised tea cups for sale... Would definitely recommend this place to hangout wid frnds and have a good time.... Thank you tea pea|positive
Rated #Nearest Place to Donut-Up With my Best Donut Buddy #Early-Morning-Donut-Cravings #Infinite Visits #Co-operative & Polite Staff #Quite Small Place #The Lemon Iced-Tea ( No No) #The Double Trouble�?�? #The Dark Knight �? #The Chocolate Bomb�?�? #Time To Get back to Work|positive
Rated I just love the donuts that you get here! Price is pretty decent too and it's located at the centre of mahavir Nagar, so over all a good place for a donut treat! �?�|positive
Rated Have had all the donuts from the menu. This place is a nice cute little place. Double Trouble always remains my favourite from the list. :))|positive
Rated Like every other mod this place also has to offer the best that you can get in donuts... Really like the donuts here..... Did nt try the double trouble here at this outlet... Which is one of my favorites.... However like the sugar quoted blue bery donut|positive
Rated I mean how can I start with this review this place is awesome.. the donuts are like yummy... before I used to hate donuts but after eating the hazel dazel donut u get it out here I have always loved donuts now! They are good with their work and love this place..😀|positive
Rated Lovely place... A much needed donut spot in Kandivli west. The donuts are always fresh and perfect. Double trouble is my all time favourite with the gooey chocolate filling. Original sin and the savoury donuts are also tasty. Summers are the best time when they have their seasonal mango specials. A good place to hang out..|positive
Rated One place where you can never go wrong for donuts. They had new gulab jamun variety on occasion of diwali. Donuts always taste fresh and have good variety.|positive
Rated It's a small outlet but quite neat. The staff is kind and swift. The donuts were freshly made. And they had stocked out almost all their flavours.|positive
Rated I visited this place and did a take away thingy.. First and foremost, this was the first restaurant which charged me for plastic containers, so that I could take away the food. This is so pathetic, do they expect customers to bring their own containers, If so, it definitely deserves a mention in the menu "BRING YOUR OWN CONTAINERS". I'm sure people wouldn't mind. I would sincerely suggest em to revise their prices so as,that they can afford not to charge for containers. So coming to food, what I ordered Thai pad noodles And the original Veg Manchurian gravy Thai pad noodle were really decent, perfectly cooked, perfect taste and it was all there.. I loved it totally. The vegetables in the noodles were soft too. Now comes the disaster part, the Manchurian, I knw Manchurian has garlic, but the Manchurian at this place was like loaded with like seriously tooo much Garlic, and I'm not exaggerating.. Every spoon tasted more garlicky, it had become more of a garlic gravy than a Manchurian one. Yuck it was. Surely not at all worth the amount I paid for it. I has some amazing expectations, but all in vain.. I wanted to try their dimsums and their Italian menu, but now I do have second thoughts.|positive
Rated The food is nice, service is excellent, place is good! Ambiance is decent,but the best of all is it is value for money! Also,it's in between the town,and a great place for vegetarians to visit! Ambiance: 3/5 Food:3/5 Service:4/5 Value for money: 3.5/5|positive
Rated This place is located in the ever crowded and busy street of Mahavir Nagar. We happened to come across this place while looking for some new options and we were surely not disappointed at all. The place looks tiny but trust me this factor can easily be ignored. The owner showed a very welcoming gesture everytime I visited, the servers are very courteous and the food here is not at all tight on pocket. They serve chinese and thai cuisine which is modified as per the Indian taste. We had ordered Nachos with Jalepeno Cheese dip (perfect taste, huge portion, delicious), Chilly potatoes(not too great but above average), Vegetable dimsums (again not very great but above average, served sooper hot and good portion size) Manchurian ball sizzler (I loved it thoroughly, had the perfect balance os spices, tasted sooper delicious and perfect portion size) and Fried ice cream (tasted pretty good). I have been to this place thrice by now and I am sure to visit them again to try out their other stuffs mentioned in their long menu. Strongly recommended.|positive
Rated This place is located just opposite dmart. So one day after shopping decided to give it a try. I had opted for the awesome threesome dimsums 😜 and for the dessert had opted for honey tossed noodles with vanila icecream. The service was quick and the food was great. The dimsums were served with schezwan chutney and sweet chili sauce if i recollect properly. I would say this was the best dimsums you could have in kandivali and would recommend it to give it a try. About the honey tossed noodles with vanila icecream also know as daarsan the only issue i had was it was a bit too sweet for my taste. Overall had a good experience. �?|positive
Rated This is a new place in Mahavir Nagar, Kandivali (East) located in an area famous for food. So we ordered, • Phad Thai Noodles The noodles were amazing and worth the money we paid with enough quantity. We ordered just one dish because we wanted to check out this place for future plans. The service was good and quick. Food: Very-good Ambience: Moderately good Service: Very-good|positive
Rated Since this place is new and they still have some work pending, I chose to go with one dish only. The place is small but has a better decor than the others on the same side of the street. The menu is partly khow chow and partly suited for the Gujju based locality here. Pad Thai noodles were a value for money. Every element in it was perfect. Hope to see this tiny place make wonders.Ritika Rajput|positive
Rated It's a small Eatery right at a busy Street without any ambience. But don't let that criteria let u skip this place.. Food is just awesome and very different, loved every bite of it.. order anything and won't be disappointed. Must Visit!! Happy Eating!!|positive
Rated It is a small food joint with hardly four five tables but their hospitality and speciality is by no means small. They serve one of the most delicious Chinese food in the suburbs for reasonable prices. I visit this place often for the love of their dimsums , tofu in oyster sauce and sizzlers. Never disappointed. Kudos to the team and the humble host. Fine taste and next door neighbor appeal makes it a perfect place to keep coming back.|positive
Rated The newly opened small place in mahavir nagar which takes ones attention by its name only 'khow chow' ... its different and catchy. Definately the best out of all the eating outlets in that line. The chinese and thai food is good in taste and quality. Even d chinese sizzler which was nice tastewise and good in quantity too. The rates doesnt give pain to the pocket at all. .... its definately value for money.|positive
Rated Khow Chow stands out from all the hustle bustle of the ever crowded Mahavir Nagar. Their restaurants' look is appealing from outside and upon entering, you feel comforted by the space you are provided as they have closed curtains on both sides which blocks your view of all the other food joints in the same line. You can actually focus on what you want to eat. Which is a very positive point and they pulled it off successfully! I loved the short and sweet ambience of this place, its very clean, they have nice seating arrangements of proper dining tables and chairs, so basically you are at full ease. The tiny details of the decor are influenced by the drive to make this place look fresh and chinese. The menu is very interesting and not that lengthy at all. They have something of everything! From soups, salads, appetizers, noodles, rice, gravies, pastas, pizzas ! And yet the menu isnt lengthy. We ordered for the Nachos with Jalapeno Cheese Dip, and the quantity was much enough for two hungry grownups. Their dip was amaaazing. And the nachos were topped with corn and bell pepper and it was just too good to be true for Mahavir Nagar. Next was, Schezuan Noodles, which also tasted yummy, wasnt that spicy enough so we had to order for extra schezuan sauce, that costed an extra 20 bucks. But, nevermind. Once that came, the noodles were awesome! I really like this place, being a chinese food fanatic, Khow Chow is exciting, reasonable and serves good quality food !|positive
Rated Beginning A outlet that got me interested thanks to the rating it currently has on zomato & came across it through random chance on the search list. So once I reached near the location on the map & could not spot, I had noticed a small stand which made me think this cannot be the place & once I call the shop to confirm it was the small road side place without any board to indicate that it was dharma's. --------------------- Appearance The appearance sent a big alarm bell in my head, even I was a bit disappointed by looking at it, even the hygiene is not that good. If you are the type that easily gets turned off by a place that does not have proper seating & ambiance then this is not the place for you. It's a average road side street shop at the side of a building & nothing really else to talk about it. --------------------- Service & Preparation Speed It's roadside stall so a good service is not expected, but still the shop owner interacted very well with the customers & he seemed to be familiar with a lot of the college students that frequented at his shop. The average preparation speed of their sandwich can range from 30 sec to 1 min ( for a not toasted variant)to 2 mins (for a toasted variant). Thanks to there being a rush I had wait a long time to get my order ready which led to it becoming cold by time I brought it home. Since they do not home delivery I gave my order from the phone & told them to prepare it & I will pick it up. So when I went after 30 mins & was expecting the order to be ready, it wasn't ready & they made my order in front on me, which pissed me off & I felt like flipping their stall & leaving. But I was just not in the mood to start something plus I was really tired & hungry. --------------------- Food In total I have tried five different varieties of their sandwich - Chocolate toast, Pasta mayonnaise toast, Keema Chilli Toast, Chinese Cheese toast, Manchurian Chilli toast. All of the sandwiches have different variety on their taste, which was quite surprising for me. Since basically it's normal expected that most sandwich places(which aren't a really big shop), all of them have literally the same taste & just minor changes in the stuffing. The best was the Chinese cheese toast, which was a two layered sandwich stuffed with the their own variation of Chinese Manchurian balls & their in-home sauce. --------------------- Ending FINAL OUTPUT - It's a good outlet, the place where it's located isn't exactly a good location but the quality of food is good enough to attract a decent crowd for a roadside stall. Even the pricing to quality ratio is good, only one major problem with going here is that there is a lot of crowd here so you have to wait a few mins for your order to be completed.|positive
Rated Suprising to see Dharma on Zomato. Me and my friends used to be regulars at Dharma's back in our college days and do visit it occassionally now as well and I believe have tasted every sandwich on his menu! He makes some real lip smacking mayonaise toast sanwiches which are kinda his forte. The Dharma Special(DSP), kebab sandwich and pasta are among his best! The chocolate sandwich and Russian salad are also nice dishes to try sometimes! To conclude, I would say that my college is around a good 2-3 km away and we did have other sandwich restos nearby, yet we travelled the distance to dharma's....so trust me guys, if a meat lover goes this far for veg sandwiches, they sure gotta be real good!|positive
Rated This guy serves one of the most amazing and innovative sandwiches in the suburbs! You get a wide range of sandwiches here! It's one of the few vegetarian things I would happily spend my money upon! Pasta mayonnaise,kebab mayonnaise and Manchurian chilly mayonnaise are some The most consumed and loved variants here! Hearty amounts of mayonnaise and cheese constitute the rich flavours of the fillings! Add this one to your bucket list if you haven't been here!|positive
Rated You are in for a treat if u are a sandwich lover . The stuffings here are just out of the world. You will get to taste an amazing combinations of flavour which you Won't find in any ordinory restaurant if you order a sandwich there. Once you taste it you are sure to order the rest of the sandwhiches in the menu and the best thing is you can have 4 sandwhiches at a time and still won't be satisfied. The place is very pocket friendly. Do go with your college friends if u owe them a treat.|positive
Rated Great service! Visited this place quite often All the sandwiches are beyond excellence.... Taste is soo yummy soo creamy... Visit once n I bet ul want to visit this place again and again <3|positive
Rated Relli different kind of sandwiches A new concept Pasta sandwich is the best samdwich u gt der�?��?.|positive
Rated All type of best sandwiches available ? Once u visit i bet you will go again n again Its taste is just awesome ? Food 5/5 Taste 5/5|positive
Rated After hearing about this place from a friend, I decided to visit it.. A small sandwich stall (like a baakda sandwich wala). Has so many different varieties of sandwiches. The DSP, i.e. Dharma special is a must try.. Even Manchurian sandwich and pasta sandwich are good. And you must end your meal with a chocolate sandwich. A good place for sandwiches|positive
Rated In a Predominantly Gujarati area a sandwich stall is always a hit!! But a man of this creative mind deserves the fan following he has. From Chinese noodle toast to Italian pasta toast to chocolate toast.. Dharma was the first place i came across this kind of fusion food.. (I know a few friends who have attempted such things in desperate times but am yet to come across an enterprise that has been this fun) Well about the food.. I personally dint like a lot of other toasts i tried.. But the Dharmas special toast and the chocolate toast is definitely worth a try.. And see what new the warm and stylist andhraite 'Dharma' and his nephews have to offer.|positive
Rated Quality: Very good Quantity: Very good Service: Super Fast Total Value for money. A hot spot for college goers ! In love with the place at first bite :)|positive
Rated My friend can vouch for dosas here. N I wasn't disappointed. They have really some good variety. You can try any, I think you wouldn't be disappointed. Staff is really nice.|positive
Rated If you want to have delicious, mouthwatering and innovative varieties of dosas, this is the place to go. Well, this is kind of a low profile place so there is actually no decor whatsoever. However, they have a small air-conditioned section now. Its USP is fusion dosas which are worth every penny. Cheese Paneer Chilly, Nandu's Special Dosa series are my personal favourites. This place is too jampacked on weekends and holidays.|positive
Rated Great place! The variety of dosas is too good and must try. Also very pocket friendly. Menu: Offers wide variety of dosas, tried 6 different types and all tastes unique and superb.|positive
Rated If you are in mood of good dosas, want to sit and eat but don't want it to be heavy on pocket, then this is the place to be. It has a decently spaced area in open for seating and is generally very crowded but they are quick in their service. I have stayed quite close to it and thus it used to be one of 'frequently order from' places. It also serves Sandwiches and Pizza in addition to Dosas, Uttapam and Idlis. The usual ones are quite nice but some others I have really liked are: - Choupsey Dosa (Chinese noodles and schezwan masala stuffing), - Bhaji Dosa (pav bhaji stuffing), - Gini Dosa (Veggies, cheese and right spices) and - Pizza Dosa (tastes similar to one of the local fast food joint pizzas). Dosas can be a little spicy. If you don't eat spicy food, do specify when you order. They will make it to your preferences. Idli are nice tasting and fresh too. Would absolutely recommend this place for a VFM dosa meal:)|positive
Rated As there is a saying: I'll just tweak it a bit_ Nandu's naam hi kaafi hai! Amazing and yummiest dosas! With a great variety and each variety is worth trying! I visit this place many times and would surely recommend all to go n visit this place once!|positive
Rated Super crowded place during the weekends beacause they probably serve the best and the most variety of dosa's that uve heard of.. definitely a vegetarians heaven and offcourse even a good tryout for nonvegetarians who want to try out something filling in vegetarian. the ambience is normal ,major drawback would be the service you always need to be on the lookout for them to give out your order. ps- u might wanna carry some extra cash coz even though the menu is cheap you end up trying a variety of dosa's :D|positive
Rated The south indian dishes are superb. As the name suggests this place is known for its varieties of dosas. The ambience is not good but the is food is amazing Must try: 1. Spl. Manchurian dosa 2. Paneer cheese chilly dosa 3. Jini dosa 4. Nandu spl. Dosa 5. Choclate dosa|positive
Rated This place has nothing much to talk about expect for their awesome dosas! Try any one on the cards and I am sure you are gonna love them. My fav here is the corn cheese dosa.|positive
Rated Globalization has introduced us to different cuisines of the world. Little did we know that our regional food would also undergo such a drastic 'change'. Now an eatery comes up that serves dosas (gone are the days where a sada and masala dosa would suffice) but with such wide variety of options that we are left scratching our head thinking what should we order. I found myself in such a spot at Nandu Dosa. The Dosas : Off late this eatery has gained a lot of popularity. So i went there with sky rocket expectations. After getting confused (never ending options) we settled for Nandu Special Dosa. It was good. We concluded by ordering sada dosa (my personal favourite). To be fair, there are many places in Borivali itself that serve better dosas. Food → 3/5 Location : Nandu dosa is located at a good spot (near a school and a public park) which must have proved beneficial for them. I thought it would be a small place but it has laid out quite a number of tables. Ambience → 2.5/5 Service : I expected fast service from them and they were bang on. A good sign when you are really hungry → 3/5 I still dont find myself in a right position to review this place as it will take atleast 5-6 visits to exactly know where their strength and weakness lies (the options are aplenty). Till then Nandu Dosa still remains to be explored.|positive
Rated Serves awesome variety of dosa's and not heavy on your pocket. Every item ordered was delicious. Tried Cheese palak dosa, nandu's special pizza dosa and jinni dosa.|positive
Rated It does call for a Starbucks visit when you want to have a good conversation. This time, headed for the one at Kandivali. Ambience: This is one of the larger Starbucks and one of the most organized one. When you step in, you do feel like you are entering a place where you can sit, enjoy coffee and engage in a discussion unlike some other outlets which are so cramped up. The shades of wood are pleasing to the eye and the well positioned shelves add to the ethnicity. Food and experience: It was the first time ever I tried some food at a Starbucks, the corn and cheese open face sandwich. It was sufficient for a person and was a perfect accompaniment to a cold coffee. Down to the main business, I had my ever favorite Caramel Frappucino. I would have preferred a bit more caramel in it but it was good nonetheless. Service: Service was quick and all our queries were answered promptly. No complaints on this front. We did switch tables when we spotted a better sitting. The wait staff was quick in clearing the table for us. Verdict: I would prefer going to this outlet simply for the well-organized setup. You are ensured you are not sitting so close to the adjoining table that you can overhear their conversation. Quality of food and beverages remain consistent as other outlets.|positive
Rated Bandra's envy, Kandivali's pride... Damn, this is one spacious Starbucks... One coffee shop that I make it a point to stop by whenever I have meetings in the area.. They have a variety of seating here, from the more business like chair & tables to the lazed out sofas... That caramel latte somehow tastes better when you're not seated on those horrible high seats at the Bandra reclamation branch :)|positive
Rated This is probably the only Starbucks outlet that I liked a lot. It has a spacious, pleasant interior with earthy brown tones dominating the decor. Bonus points for the western classical music that was being played on the sound system, which was really lovely. We ordered a red velvet and chocolate espresso (blended coffee) and green tea along with some snacks. The coffee and tea were extremely good. The snacks were not that great though. However, all in all, it was a nice experience. Will visit again.|positive
Rated My favourite Starbucks outlet. It has ample number of tables and the ambience is quite fitting to the brand name. The staff behaves well and the service is prompt too. For a change, they call out your name rather than shouting. It is always occupied but you will always find a place to sit.|positive
Rated I have always been a starbucks fan, but the starbucks in kandivali west disappointed me to the core... No doubt the staff is good and well behaved... But yesterday i had been there and me and a frnd sat on a table which was vacated by a couple, and their tray and left overs were left unattended by the staff for almost 30 mins after them leaving After being totally bugged by this i had to go myself and ask them to clear it up as it was not looking nice, This is a kind of thing u wud never expect at a starbucks... But anyways, the place is very cute i can say, coffee jars placed in shelves....a big poster of coffee seeds....smell of coffee all over d place calms me down :) The seating is very much comfortable... Would definitely give the kandivali branch one more try in the near future...|positive
Rated Thank you, STARBUCKS COFFEE for opening an outlet in our vicinity, i.e. Kandivali. Love all your products. The cups and mugs are a bit over priced and only gives a low, very low discount if we barge in with the purchased Starbucks product, making it not that worth. Though, they're the best ones.|positive
Rated Amazing ambience, good coffee and deserts. In addition, a fantastic place to have a chat. Also good to work on your stuff. The ambience makes u wanna sit there for hours. Will try their snacks next time.|positive
Rated Most fav coffee spot in kandivali west. After every tiring workout/ grocery shopping at golds gym and dmart respectively which located just next to it. I would prefer a hot cup of coffee or just some hot chocolate and starbucks knows how to make the best coffee and hot chocolate😚. I know its a bit pricy compared to ccd which is located just at the corner but the taste can not be matched.|positive
Rated This outlets lies at a perfect place. The are is huge and the service lies amazing as always. The best part about this outlet is that it's ambience is amazing. There's not much seating available but its quite huge.|positive
Rated Im in love with the Hot Chocolate these people make it that too without sugar and without cream , its just yummy . Place is good , service is fine as its self service , interior is also ok, comfortable place to have a word with the specially loved people of ours 🙃🙃 Im a big fan of Starbucks for their Hot Chocolate.|positive
Rated The food over here is just fab i couldn't stop myself to write about it.....you guys just make those kebab just like it has come from heaven and you guys have just kept the name by serving those delicious kebabs and other food items like biryani you cook....thumbs up!!|positive
Rated Ordered 2 kathi rolls after reading all the good reviews on Zomato. The person who answered the call from the restaurant was extremely warm and sweet.....in fact helpful in suggestions regarding what to order. I like it when the owner or the show runner is confident, this makes the experience of trying a new place more positive. He suggested a paneer sholay kebab roll and one paneer basil garlic tikka roll. Both were very different in taste from each other......one was a nice combo flavours like a sweet, spicy, garam Masala and soft paneer......whereas the other one was loaded with garlicky paneer flavour. Personally I liked the paneer sholay one more. But overall both were fine. In fact these are the first kathi rolls I have tried in borivali. So def its wasn't a bad experience at all.....prefer eating at the restaurant or stall rather than home delivery as it gets a bit soggy by the Time it reaches ur home. Overall �?|positive
Rated This place is only for take aways or home delivery! Tried veg dum biryani and paneer basil garlic tikka. The starter was awesome, quality of paneer, flavor everything was great. The biryani was good, not as great as the paneer starter. The quantity is also good!|positive
Rated The most delicious biryani corner across Borivali! You get the most exotic paneer tikka biryani wid yummy raita is what yu need in your dinner plate. Thumps up �?�?� please include more North Indian dishes im ur menu. And to add up, the packaging of the parcel and quantity is applauding! If yu believe in quality, quantity and taste in an affordable price please try this. :)|positive
Rated Just saw a banner and followed it while I had some work near Borivili station. The joint is a small shop which has no seating are so i think it is mostly for take aways. I tried their chicken tikka roll which was descent. The roomali roti was made fresh which was the best part. There were usual sauces and the roasted chicken tikka in the wrap.|positive
Rated Finally took a parcel from kebab land today since I wanted to try out their kebabs. Took home a chicken rajasthani kebab and it was bursting with flavour! It was a little spicy for my liking, but enjoyed it nevertheless. Will try more food next time.|positive
Rated Beginning A random place that I one day noticed while walking near borivali station while I was on my way to meet up with my sister to do some shopping. It is difficult to know such a place existed unless you notice the small board just outside the now dead Jaya Theater. It located just before you reach the theater. This place gave new hope of finally finding a place that will give a good place to order from since in borivali both east & west(excluding IC Colony Area) doesn't really have good quality place that serves both veg & non-veg food. But this place ended up serving out a bag of mixed result. --------------------- Appearance It's a small place with no option to dine-in, it just has a kitchen & it's a pure take away/home delivery place which are becoming common place nowadays. Instead of investing on a large place for customers to sit, they cram their kitchen into a small space & can spend more to get better equipment. So they can solely focus on their food without having to worry about maintaining other parts of their shop that they do not consider really important. --------------------- Service & Delivery Speed Nothing can be said about the service since it's a take away/home delivery place. While ordering the combo meal the individual on the phone was not exactly familiar what was available in it. Otherwise the order was taken without much of a problem & he was courteous enough. On my two times ordering from here, the first time the order took a long time(1 hour 10 mins) to deliver so sadly the food was already cold (it could not be helped since that day was a festive day, so expecting a order to be delivered quickly would be preposterous). On the second time during afternoon delivery the order was delivered with the time(40-50 mins) allotted by them & food was delivered hot(thankfully, that day I had friends over so it would have spoiled the mood to eat cold food). --------------------- Food On my two deliveries from here I had ordered - Chicken Tikka Biryani, Chicken Dum Biryani, One Roomali Roti, Tawa Paratha, Chicken Lasooni roll, Chciken Reshmi roll, Chicken Pahadi Tandoori Half, Chicken Tandoori Lollipop, Chicken Banjara Kebab,The Daily Combo Meal which included Tandoori Roti, Chicken Gravy, Rajma Gravy, Plain Biryani Rice & Gajar Halwa, Matka Kulfi. Both the Biryani's were below average in taste, even after a consuming it I can't even remember how it tasted like a day later, the taste was so forgetful. While the biryani was boring the quality of their tandoor items kicks up a level, their Roomali Roti, Tawa Paratha & Tandoori Roti all of them were well done even without relying on their butter variant. All of them broke without any effort, I did even have to bother using both my hands to do so, which is a good thing any day. Banjara Kebab, Chicken Tandoori Lollipop - both of them were really good, well cooked & they were really juicy, worth trying many times. Chicken Pahadi Tandoori Half - This was my first time trying this variant, though it was slightly burnt in some parts & it was dry, but the chicken was tender & still tasted good. Chicken Lasooni Roll & Chicken Reshmi Roll - It was just kebab pieces in a roomali roti rolled up with other stuff in it. Thanks to kebabs being their main signature dishes(at least according to their name), the taste was significantly good. Chicken Gravy - It was okay, it was mainly used by me to make the plain biryani rice in the combo meal worth consuming, it wasn't really spicy. Gajar Halwa - It was given in small quantity as per the combo meal. It was okay, sweet enough but not worth ordering it separately. Matka Kulfi - It was ordered on the day the delivered was delayed, so it was defrosted & even keeping it in the freezer for more than half hour did not help recover its original texture. So was a bit disappointed with the slightly melted kulfi & could not enjoy it that much. --------------------- Ending FINAL OUTPUT - This place is only really good for their tandoor items - their kebab, all their assorted breads & even the tandoori chicken. Biryani & their gravy can be improved. The desserts were just average nothing worth talking about. Just based on their Tandoor items I would have rated this place 3.5-4.0, but the overall quality & bad experience of the first delivery is what lead to the current rating. Once the store has an idea of where the location of delivery, they can deliver the food more efficiently without much problem. They might have had a problem locating my home address since they are not used to delivering on the east side, but on my second time they delivered it quickly.|positive
Rated Mission : To find a place in Borivli that serves great non vegetarian food. Result : Not worth mentioning. The above story is the reason why i get excited whenever i see a new place opening in Borivali thinking this is it. This place might satiate my wish of having a kick ass non vegetarian place. Kebabland (though located at a not so good place) gave me that hope. So after a hectic day i came back home tired. With various options popping out from my phone book i decided to give Kebab Land a try (this story suggests that Kebab land is a take away joint with an option of home delivery) which means we have to strike out the ambience part while reviewing this place. So to become a success kebabland relies heavily on their food (taste and quality) and to provide spot on service when it comes to home delivery. I will start off with its food. I asked for their suggestion while ordering the food where they recommended me to try Rajasthani Kebabs. And along with them i ordered chicken tikka Biryani. Biryani was decent (there are other places with better biryanis). Rajasthani kebabs were too good (spicy and juicy). It was a worthy try. The quantity was enough for two people and the quality was good. While they scored good marks in the food department, i was thoroughly disappointed with their service and attitude. They took an hour or so to deliver the food. When i called up to check on them, their spokesperson blamed me for not giving a proper address and hence the delay. On asking the same question to the delivery boy, he gave the reason of broken cycle for the delay. Home delivery is tricky because you have to serve food while its hot. I will have to think twice before ordering there again even though i liked their food. Thats the sad part.|positive
Rated Its good worth family resto to go.. Food is good.... service is well.. Not much priced too..... Ambience is vaise ok.. But u cn see babhai naka traffic :p|positive
Rated Been there few days back for dinner. Good clean place located in Borivali West on a busy street. Ordered a clear soup, paneer pasanda (not too spicy) Daal tadka n jeera rice. Loved the paneer pasanda. It was stuffed and had green chutney inside. Yummy. Dal rice were also good, dal had good tadka on it.|positive
Rated Lazy afternoon...wanted to have some vegetarian food...decided to order it at home. Called up Deepak Restaurant and ordered Gold Coin's as a started and Veg Lazawab gravy along with some Roti's. Gold coin was really good,crispy base and spicy Manchurian ball's flattened over it,covered with sesame seeds. Veg Lazawab was spicy, mixed vegetables along with some paneer, good enough. Have been to the restaurant in the past. The ambience is good enough, having being divided into AC and Non-AC section's, service and costing is average.|positive
Rated Situated at famous Babhai naka.. Service is good.. Prefer visiting during weekdays.. As you would be spared by the weekend crowd.. Food wise the place is famous for the south indian dishes.. Raagi dosa.. Is unique.. For starters.. If you have a group of 5-6 people go for "Deepak spl Platter".. Good quality & quantity ... Check out the panner items for main course.. Panner Lazeez / Lajawaab .. panner was fresh.. Soft.. Also try the chochlate brownie with icecream sizzler.. .. Good service.. Proper pricing.. Ambience is great....|positive
Rated Located on the main at babhai naka.. This is One of the better family restaurants at borivali.. South Indian is pretty nice.. Punjabi too is good enough.. Nothing extraordinary or unique about this restaurant as compared to other family restaurants in that area.. It's just that quality of food is pretty good.|positive
Rated Dnt judge the book by its cover !! as rightly said ... Dont go by the NAME !!! Sounds bit cocktailed .. but Deepak offers one of the best punjabi food in borivali ... Mouthwatering classic punjabi taste.. A must for Indian food lover.. Ambience 6/10 Quality- 7/10 Taste -10/10 Quantity-8.5/10|positive
Rated Excellent punjabi food..decent place to go with family.. Great taste.. They have 2 options for serving the food AC and non AC.. Food:4/5 Service:3.5/5 Cost: moderate Ambience: 2.5/5...|positive
Rated It is located on the main road at Babhai Naka and so it is one of the popular as well as crowded restaurant. Moving on to food, the Punjabi dishes are as good as ever. The menu shows a lot of variety but I always go there for Punjabi food. The starters and even the subji have a good variety. The service is very fast. And the ambience is also fair enough. So I really recommend you guys to try it at least once. { THANK YOU }|positive
Rated If matunga is too far from the burbs and if u crave for some rasam vadas, bisibella bhaat, curd rice.....in short good south Indian food then Deepak comes to our rescue. Tangy spicy rasam is the best here. Of course they do serve everything here.....pav Bhaji, Chinese, Punjabi etc etc. But I prefer the south Indian only. Didn't enjoy the idli platter too much. Neer dosa with korma is another special. Love the special mirchi served with curd rice. In chinese, burnt garlic rice was good with the typical paneer manchurian. Somehow I liked the taste better than most udupis. Didnt like the parathas served with dal and raita too much. Good place and good service.|positive
Rated Firstly place your order before you go there since its made on demand and it might take some time so call before hand. It maybe difficult for people to find the place as I did the first time even though it's right on link road. I had the Asian style pork burger which was quite dandy and filling with potato wedges which were good too. I hope they had more options,the menu on Zomato lists only four types of burgers. I understand it's managed by the only two people but still. Overall food and the quantity,quality is great but that's about it. Cheers|positive
Rated The Burger Giant! The burgers he makes is decent and quite large and filling. We know this guy well, so we sit at his home and eat. Else, it is take away for everyone. Large Juicy burger which can give ur Gym schedule a toss! Food 4/5 Ambience 3 /5 Service 3.5/5 Value for money 4/5|positive
Rated This place serves meaty, saucy burgers to satisfy your hunger. I loved their chicken steak burger, and their beef burger was also on point. I didn't like the wedges much but the burgers were definitely good!|positive
Rated Goofy's was one of the restaurants which was definitely one of those places which i had intended to go for a long time. And so it happened on a breezy Saturday evening with my office colleagues. To start with the place, we were welcomed inside the said flat no. with wide and welcoming smiles from the the Chef in Chief Griffith himself and his Mother. Since i was not decided on what to order, The Chef himself explained up the burgers he can serve up. So we ordered a Mammoth Chicken Burger, Bacon Dusted Potato Wedges and Ice Tea. About the Burger, it was super Huge in terms of size and definitely super delicious. The Burger consisted of double cheese, sauteed mushrooms, deep fried onion rings, a hint of bacon, the chicken was beautifully flavored and tossed in the sauce with utmost perfection, the best part being your hands are bound to get all messy when u eat tasty food. The Bread was fresh and soft too. However i did feel the burger lacked an element or two, maybe some kind of greens. The potato wedges, some of em, with great disappointment were under-cooked, and the seasoning was not at all appealing. The seasoning made the potato wedges taste sweet, which for me was not attractive. The Ice tea was one of the regular Lipton ice teas which can be easily made at home. A massive dis advantage for this place would be, the place has almost limited or one may say no menu for vegetarians. So i would not suggest you to go to this place with your veggie friend For me this place is a must visit only and only if you are in the vicinity. I would rate this place 3 on 5, but the homeliness feeling and hospitality definitely deserve the additional 0.5. Having said that, i do intend to come here again, to experience the hospitality and try out some other burgers too.|positive
Rated Been here on a Saturday evening.. The place is located on the second floor of Gurukripa Bld exactly on link road. Amazed by the welcome i received by Mother-son duo who run this place, they make u feel like home. Enough space for 10 people to sit in their living room. You can even have it there or choose to take away. Ordered Chicken steak Burger which was very much filling and lip smacking. 3-4 huge pieces of chicken were put into the burger and also went for potato wedges which were also really well made. Surely coming here for more !! Taste - 4/5|positive
Rated The best and value for money burgers in town.This is based out of the chef's home. The ambience is very homely. The only downer if I could possibly point out would be the time taken for the burger to be made. but the taste is definitely worth the wait ! One of the hidden gems from suburbs !|positive
Rated So a burger joint run from home ... Just brilliant ... So after going through the menu choose to order the lamb ,pork and the chicken mammoth The best ...lamb burger ... With extra toppings of bacon worth the money spent ... Stomach full ... The second was the pork burger .. With extra toppings of bacon .. Well sorry but after eating the lamb ... The pork didn't even come close to it ... Bit more salty to my taste buds ... And the party too didn't taste that good ... The third my wife ordered for the chicken mammoth hahaha .. Her version ... Not that great ... Cause she also had a bite from the lamb burgers .. And so did I of the chicken burger ... I do t even want to talk abt it ... I completely avoided it ... Because the lamb was just pretty chunky juicy because of The burnt onions and the sauce and the extra toppings of bacon ... The taste and the chunkyness of the patty is still lingering in my mouth as I am writing this review ... It's just what awesome I feel sorry for the other two ... Because its made with lot of love ... But it for others foodies to decide not me ... But just for the lamb I would give 5 ... But the other two disappointed me .. I give it 4 ... Oh yes ... It's only take away .. And the first one you are supposed to have it in the house .. That's the tradition .... Enjoy the awesome burger ...|positive
Rated "Home away from home!" Thats what my friend calls this place... and indeed its the chef's home which makes u feely homely too! And so i decided to explore this novel kindof food joint... here's my experience.. So it started with the warm welcoming smile of the chef and his mom when they open the door and asked what we would like to have. We ordered for chicken steak burgers and potato wedges. While we sat down on the sofa enjoying the TV and chit chatting... chef and his mom cooked for us...I wouldn't say the burgers were served quickly unlike some other fast food joints(read McDonald's �?) which we are used to ...But i didnt find the wait too long... and even if it is,trust me the wait is worth it�?... so we were served with hot and freshly cooked potato wedges and burgers! The burger looked huge (or is my jaw small 😛) ...chicken cooked in tangy, a lil sweet caramelized sauce and chopped onions tasted juicy, tangy and delicious! �? and the stuffing was generous! I was almost drowned with the quantity of food�? Also the hot wedges were perfectly cooked not too soft not too dry... and they were sprinkled with some spices...salty and moderately spicy i dont think it was oregano but something similar to it �? So in a nutshell... this place is for those who prefer good food over fancy floor... while i would recommend that its best for take aways... i did not find it awkward to eat my delicious burger at chef's dinning table 😀|positive
Rated Living in Borivali since childhood I have struggled a lot to find a good enough burger place. I heard about this place from a few friends and wanted to try it for quite a while. And finally we decided to visit this place and it was all worth it. Those were easily the best burgers I ever had. The patty was so juicy, so tender and so full of flavours that all you're left with after finishing it is cravings for more. I had an Asian Pork Burger and a Chicken Steak Burger. Though both were absolutely amazing, the pork wins my heart. All patties are dressed in different sauces/gravy. Definitely worth numerous more visits!|positive
Rated Looking at for burger that will satisfy your belly? Goofy's is your joint.Homemade and delcious is its USP I suppose. However would love to see more dishes added to their menu.|positive
Rated I loved the food. Having lived in Bangalore for more than a decade, the food filled me with nostalgia too!! We had the banana crispies (unfortunately didn't come with the chutney, but only the ketchup). We also had the most awesome pumpkin dosa...the hostess claimed it to be unique in Mumbai and Bangalore. I believe the first part for sure :) The sol kadi was pungent and garlicky, but refreshing. Finally, the mango matka paysa...well, the king of fruits needs no review rating!! Missed the highly recommended Khotti idlis...will keep it for the next time!|positive
Rated Could have been better. Had heard a lot of good reviews about it so had decided to try it. But was disappointed by the experience. Not worth repeating.|positive
Rated I am a Mangalorean and love the food we eat. I wanted my fiancé to taste authentic South Indian food after being disappointed to taste what was being served at South Indian joints in Mumbai. I remember ordering Neer Dosa at a famous Matunga joint and what they gave was a brown Dosa. So I ordered Pan Pollo at Simply Saraswat which means Neer Dosa in Konkani. And it was so soft and fluffy! Just the way I was expecting. We also ordered Dakshin Idli as per the restaurants suggestion and it was great too. Had Sol Kaddi and Chaas from their drinks menu. Overall the food was good. Authentic South Indian - Mangalorean food joint.|positive
Rated We are absolute south Indian food fanatics and have had expeditions to try the best in the city. We often visit Matunga, mumbai’s south Indian food paradise, to commit gluttony. One Sunday evening, while casually surfing Zomato, we came across this high rated south Indian joint not very far from our vicinity. Overwhelmed by the proximity and high rating, there we were at Simply Saraswat. It was a small joint surrounded by a couple of other eateries and is an easy find. This place had decent and neat interiors for a South Indian speciality restaurant. Reading through the wall clad newspaper articles on their restaurant we realised that it was more specifically Chitrapur Saraswat cuisine. We were keeping our fingers crossed. While going through the menu we could hardly decide what to order looking at the wide variety of available options. Decided to go for the dosa platter in order to get our hands dirty with more than one of their servings. They had six varieties of mini dosas accompanied with sambar, rasam, potato bhaji and 3 types of chutneys. Dosas were not the regular ones you get in the city. As a matter of fact the names were also quite different. The six doasas served were Kanara sada pollo, Pan pollo, Surnoli, Teen dal pollo with gunpowder & ghee, Loni pollo and spinach corn cheese dosa. Out of the six servings we managed to like just three. Kanara pollo which was more like a masala dosa tasted good because of the amazing flavour to the potato bhaji. Pan plool was nice being more like neer dosa. Teen dal pollo with gunpowder & ghee was like the name suggests a multi grain dosa made of moong, udad and chana sprinkled with podi masala. We did not like the rest three for the lack of right flavour and taste. Among the accompaniments sambar and coconut chutney were just about satiable but the rasam and rest of the chutneys were no good. After being disappointed with this dish we still ordered for piyush. Piyush is more of a maharashtrian curd based drink. It was far from what it originally is. It was a thin mixture of watered curd and was artificially flavoured. After this try we had no reason to order further. Our discovery turned tragic and our Sunday dinner left us craving for good food. Staff is courteous but untrained and deserves no special mention. Crisply we do not look to visit them again and neither do we recommend them as a try. gluttonyreviews.wordpress.com|positive
Rated I love South Indian food and always on a hunt for good places serving it. Simply Saraswat had been on my wishlist since long. They serve not so regular South Indian cusine. They have very different and authentic dosas and idlis along with some modern fusion dishes. It is a small place next to 5 Spice with indoor and outdoor seating.. indoor consisting of 8-9 tables. The ambiance is descent and the place is done simple but quite well, definitely better than most udipi restaurants. What I ordered- Mini Dosa Platter- Just one word to describe it! Excellent! This platter consists of 6 Mini dosas/ pollo which are not exactly mini in size... along with chutneys, sambar, rasam and potato bhaji. Each dosa tasted different, had a different texture and were served with pure ghee or house made makhan(white butter). All the dosas were excellent. Pan Pollo-Thin, Soft, Fluffy melt in your mouth texture, plain white paired well with all the chutneys, bhaji, sambar or rasam. Surnali- Extremely soft and fluffy, again melt in your mouth texture, slighty sweet and yellow in color served with pure ghee/makhan paired well with everything. Corn Spinach Cheese Pollo- Good stuffing, tasty and enjoyable by itself. Well seasoned! Loni Pollo- Soft and Fluffy melt in your mouth dosa with ghee/makhan plain white udad dal dosa paired well with everything. Teen Daal Pollo with Pudi and Ghee- Soft Fluffy dosa sprinkled with pudi.. enjoyable by itself or the bhaji. Very good! Kanara Sada Pollo- Very good! This dosa was like the mysore sada but a little milder version in terms of the spice. Thin and lite with a tasty spread of mysore chutney... paired best with everything. I loved all the dosa be it simple or fancy. Good enough for two. Mini Thali Meal- Good! This meal consisted of 3 chapatis, rasam, 2 vegetables - masala vangi i.e brinjal potato and a cauliflower curry. I opted for sol kadhi instead of raita. This meal is enough just for one. The brinjal potato vegetable had coconut and tasted just excellent! The most delicious brinjal sabji I ever had. It was perfectly seasoned. The cauliflower curry was coconut based too and was good.. not wow as the brinjal. The rasam here is excellent! It is a little different than the regular one served at most udipis. It was a little thick in consistency and also has a wonderful asefotedia flavor. Correct amount of spice... not too spicy and perfectly seasoned. Sol Kadhi- Excellent! Yummy tempered kokum kadhi which was well seasoned. Yum! Yum! This place serves some real delicious food and is a must visit for South Indian food lovers. A good family restaurant. Definitely will go back for more. Good VFM.|positive
Rated This place is simply simple and serves good south Indian food. The menu has a good variety to explore. Try their appes and masala poha rather than the usual dosas and uttappas.|positive
Rated Simply Saraswat is simply the best South Indian restaurant in borivali area. For long me and my wife have been hunting for places to find proper authentic South Indian food and we were happy to spot this place here. We tried multiple dishes such as bopla dodak, surnoli, dosa with gun powder, filter coffee, Dahi wada. Everything available here had a mind blowing taste and was mesmerising. I was happy to find even the goli bajje on the menu. Last but not the least was the excellent reception that the lady owner gave us. She ensured we had a nice time. I would return here again for a sumptuous meal....|positive
Rated Simply Saraswat is very true to it's name. Since I was super hungry when I visited, I ordered a Mini Dosa Platter which otherwise is a meal for two. They served six varieties of dosas with sabji, rasam, sambhar and 3 chutneys. Not only it was filling but also scored high on the authentic tastes. Plus they serve on a banana leaf which reminded me of my own traditions in my native home (Bengal). And yes, I did part after treating myself with some hot and sweet Sukrundo, another of their saraswat specialities. Next time I am coming for the Bhopla Doddak and Puddi Idlis!|positive
Rated Simple is a bygone word for this south ethnic marvel dishes serving restaurant. The idli batter was perfectly ground as the idli tasted so perfect. Met with owner of the restaurant...after speaking with her understood that she's the mind behind this beautiful resto where the ambience sports a coastal konkan vividness and has a well nurtured staff...the moment you are handed with the menu you will have a rush in your head to order all what's there...and which what we did as we were missing most of the authentic dishes Mangalore is famous for...I would put up a strong recommendation to fellow foodies to visit this restaurant and get acquainted with eclectic Mangalore dishes...don't try but relish..I would like to thank the restaurant for the amazing food and ambience on the morning of the Saturday :)|positive
Rated Chota packet, bada bomb. Sort of apt for this place which you would conveniently miss even if you passed by it. On entering the railway station kind of benches dont really do justice to the kind of food and juices served here. You are bound to be stuck on the menu while you order juices. The juices like Lal Quila, Thankyou, Anarkali etc etc simply dont have any relation to the juice being served (a simple description would really help). The waiters are however helpful in the same. It is difficult to recommend any juice because I clearly dont remember the names. The juices however were all good and upto the mark. The food is a highlight of the place. In such a plce you usually dont expect the food to be of high quality as it is usually treated as accompaniments. Here however, the case is different. The schezwan idli, corn cheese sandwich and the hara bhara kebab were all finger licking good and filled our stomach. Thank god for the lack of shenanigans in the names here. Truly a kind of place where the heart is content when you leave. 3menwalking.com|positive
Rated Variety of juices & starters for the adventurous. Their USP is strange names.. So mostly you'll end up confused. It's safe to try a cheesy starter and litchi based juice. I found most shakes too sugary esp. Pina Colada. Chocolate based shakes might be better. You can also try indianised versions of international food. A fun place for once in awhile.|positive
Rated Bunty's.. famous for its juices .. Small sitting area.. Crowded during weekends.. The juices comes with a twist.. Various combinations.. Starters are decent.. Though prices are bit on a higher side.. The best part is.. The order is taken from your vehicle parked in the lane near the outlet..|positive
Rated Bunty juice corner a place where I've visited a lot of times. There is a variety of juice with this juice corner. The ones in pictures are uss par(special) on the right hand side which is amazing. The one on left is mix of strawberry & kiwi. The juices are amazing. Staff- 3/5 Ambience-3/5 Juice-5/5 Price-3.5/5 Overall-3.5/5|positive
Rated A place we go post dinner to sip some juices etc...good variety of fresh juices and wonderful presentation...the names of the juices are also very inovative and attractive...its a must go ...will continue to go often..|positive
Rated Bunty's is the first name comes in the mind of any Borivali resident if you ask him/her about juices. It has nice variety of collection of juices. Though the pricing is on the higher side, and there is nothing exceptional about the juices. Though ask the waiter for his suggestion. Be choosy in what you order.|positive
Rated Had been here once, a few months back with an associate. The whole place is divided into 3 sections. One is the colorful vibranly decorated shop on the right, the other is the dull non ac segment on the left & the small ac section inside the left shop. Seating is a bit uncomfortable & the space is small getting noisy with people. Had ordered for a vegetable cheese grill sandwich & a sitafal milkshake. The time taken was about 20mins. The sandwich was crisp and tasted okish. (They should work on the chutney to make it better) The Sitafal milkshake was thick. The staff was kind & helpful. Overall a decent experience. Ps: Parking can be an issue. The menu is very extensive & confusing, choose wisely.|positive
Rated A nice place to chill with friends. Located in a new area this place was surely needed. Good hukka with a very nice service offered. Though its veg but the pizza we ordered was good. Over all would lke to visit this place again for sure.|positive

Rated Skylite as the name describes it is actually a lightning space below the sky ie their 2 rooftop areas r just amazing it gives u an experience of having sheesha underneath stars..their AC section is fun aswell, while watching cricket ppl go crazy and not to forgot their music is also cool enugh..all in all its a happening sheesha lounge with wide range of hookahs and excellent coal service you dont need to hunt for staff they are ready to assist you all the time..frnds its a mst visit place with amazing crowd :)|positive
Rated Skylite is the perfect place for chilling out with friends and relaxing in this heat/no heat. I was awed by the decor and location plus the pure veg food, which is frankly hard to find these days! Now let me tell you about the HOOKAH, which is amazing, and what makes it perfect is the continuous service one gets here(Coal change). T3 is perfect for a romantic date/hangout with friends. Its right on the link road beside Eskay resort, making it very approachable and is a sure shot place to hang out multiple times. You won't regret it ! Do try :)|positive
Rated This is a small place in IC Colony. If you're in the vicinity, you just can't miss it! It's a small place with not a lot of seating available. It feels like a nice restaurant with some tables outside. The staff are really cordial and helpful. The food here is really great. It's not like the normal chinese you eat at road side joints, because it's authentic Chinese! The taste is just perfect. It's not too spicy, not too sweet, a balance between all. The portions are really good. You can really gorge on the food without it burning a hole in your pocket. I personally recommend the Honey chilly crispy pork (it's not on the menu), salt pepper fish and the santong chicken. The pork is sweet, crispy and the heat is not overpowering. The salt pepper fish is very well prepared. The fish is so soft, it falls apart at a touch. The santong chicken is like chicken pakodas. They are best when piping hot.Ever since i've been here, i don't feel like eating at other chinese places. Lovely food, average ambience, cordial staff, overall a good experience. Average cost for 2 people aprox Rs. 500|positive
Rated A small cosy place in I C colony. Not that difficult to find as people claim it to be. Ordered chicken lollypop masala. Which not too oily neither too spicy. Nicely balanced. Then to our surprise the owner/manager came to our table and asked us how we found lollypop masala to be. Also made the rice as per our specifications. It was chicken burnt chill garlic triple rice. Quantity over here is good enough for 2. And the quality is also taken care of. Staff is really warm and owner/manager gives her personal attention for every guest. The reason i do not remember names of their dishes is, when ever i visit the restaurant, the lady at restaurant (manager/owner) attends us personally (well she does that to almost everyone) and asks us what do we expect and want to eat, they go out of the way and serve things which are not even on their menu. These people get 5 from me on service. I absolutely adore them. Haven't received such warm service even at any of elite restaurants. Top class is the word. Rating out of 5 Taste: 4 Quantity: 5 Ambiance: 3 Value for money: 4.5 Service: 5|positive
Rated Came here looking at the good zomato ratings. Ordered chicken mushroom soup, salt n pepper prawns , triple rice and Singapore noodles. all the items were having slightly different taste than the conventional chinese. Food was ok service was good. Their schezwan sauce is a bit tangy. Didnt like the prawns though. Other items were fair enough.|positive
Rated A really difficult place to locate and seriously i doubt if the food is worth the effort it takes to track down this place Although the service is prompt the food is just not upto the mark A lot many places serving better chinese than bamboo garden are still around dahisar and borivali so its definitely not a must try!|positive
Rated If uve come here then u are going to tick 3 boxes. 1) Pocket friendly 2) Indian Chinese with a slight twist 3) Good portions. The bonus u will get is that the service is excellent and the people running the place are friendly and attentive. As i know that the management follow zomato, I'd like to tell them to pay more attention to the interiors as thats one aspect which can be really improved now. The place is a tad bit difficult to find and id recommend u to read up on the review by @Thefoodasaurus to reach there with perfect precision. Overall i liked the place.|positive
Rated Located in ic colony, this place is a pretty good choice for Chinese lovers. The starters we ordered was good along with the pork dishes. Gin chicken, pork burnt red pepper, fish Thai curry and honey chicken chilly was the better among what we had ordered. Definitely worth a visit for 2nd time also.|positive
Rated Amazing Chinese I've ever had! The price for the quality of food is more than worth it. Its a small joint with no AC section. Loved the burn garlic fried rice. Also called for a couple of chicken starters which were really well done! Keep up the good work (y)|positive
Rated Chinese food lovers would really like this place...Most of the dishes here are very tasty! The Chicken Lollipops,Soups are good...Also their Chicken Hakka Noodles is really nice...Try the Honey Chilly Chicken which is very different..The pork dishes here are good too....love the Salt and Pepper Pork... They know their food well and are good at what they do...|positive
Rated Went there hoping for some great food. We ordered a chicken mushroom button soup, which turned out to be weird! They had added some egg to the soup, and the weird eggy smell from the soup made me feel eeew. I kept the soup aside. Then came our chicken lollipop. I wonder what happened to out good old chicken lollipops? Hardly anyplace serves good lollipops. :( we also ordered garlic fried rice and red pepper chicken grave which did not disappoint us much. The fried rice was great, but the red pepper chicken gravy was lacking taste. The restaurant was a bit crammed and we decided to parcel our main course after having out soup and starter! Will I visit them again? Yes may be, will order something else and try again! The staff was nicely trained and orders came very fast and the people there were very friendly and welcoming!|positive
Rated One of the best sweets shops in Borivali..high regard for taste and quality..personally love their samosas which they serve with papaya chutney.. phaafdaa ... All sweets are great!|positive
Rated They serve yummy samosas and jalebis...sweets are gud too. But i love namkeen more than sweets. So didnt try sweets here. Khaman dhokla with the papaya chutney has typical gujarati taste and i can hog on it as i like gujju food. The staff here gets 10 days summer vacation and 10 days holiday after diwali too. So the shop is closed during these days.|positive
Rated really close to borivali station, farsan tastes yummy, sweets are equally good in taste, along with ery unique flavors nice place to satisfy your sweet craving.|positive
Rated You'll get a good variety of Sweets & Farsan Items here. This place is near Borivali Railway station West & it's famous for snacks. The taste of Samosa is very nice. Among Sweets you may try Gulab jamun or Kala jamun.|positive
Rated This place is very much popular for all the snacks they just give the proper taste and give fresh food whenever u go here their will be waiting so guys just try from madhuram anything u ll nt b disappoint i m sure very much preety staff also 😅|positive
Rated For all those who have a big time sweet tooth, this is the place to go and binge on the awesome sweets that they have. The place is hygienic, polite staff, widespread of sweets and snacks, awesome taste. Almost all of their sweets are to be tried. The only thing that is painful out here is parking. Being close to the station, finding a parking is an uphill task and tedious job.|positive
Rated Considered one of the best sweet shops in Borivali West. Sweets are excellent and very fresh. Rates are on the higher side but quality justifies the pricing.|positive
Rated Very easy getaway if you are in borivali and want to rely on good quality sweets. Madhuram is known for its consistency in quality since its presence in borivali since past 12 odd years. The SAMOSA'S are a must try here. But my personal favourite is KESAR MALAI PEDA I bought during ganapati festival and they were just mind blowing <3 . They offer various Bengali sweets which are freshly made and you always treat your guest with this delicious yummy mini rassgullas. I wish they started bakery products or cake items like other stores done that street. Krutam...027!|positive
Rated Too good fresh hot jalebis and nice papdi...the greated papaya chutney needs much improvement...amazing consistency in jalebis and papdi...must have..�?|positive
Rated Ordered 100gm jalebi to check the taste and it turned out to be very good . Its worth craving for ! The sweetness and the flavour just hits the mark.|positive
Rated One of the food joints to serve best jalebis in Mumbai. Quite famous for its jalebis that they serve fresh. The price is very reasonable and you'd want to order another plate every time. Food: 4 Ambience: 2.5 Service: 3|positive
Rated #Chilly Winter's....??? Wanna treat Your Taste Buds With Some Exceptionally Awesome JALEBI #Don't Think #Come here :p The BAAAP of Desi Ghee Jalebis in Locality|positive
Rated Mumbadevi Jalebi Wala is from many generations & is known for it’s jalebi & Fadfa/Papdi. Simply delicious, Hot, Crispy & mouthwatering. This outlet is located at Raj Arcade Building, opposite D-Mart in Mahavir Nagar. This outlet is for take away only. This place is a must try for all who likes jalebi. My rating: Food Quality – 4/5 Service – 4/5 Value for Money – 4/5|positive
Rated If you are a jalebi lover (like jethalal) then this is the place. They make the jalebis fresh when you order so its hot and that's the main thing which we don't get at other places. We get the jalebis cold and the gathiyas are hot. But here the scene is opposite but I love it this way. And obviously it has opened in Kandivali just since few years but it has the name of mumbadevi which has been famous for years..|positive
Rated Mumbadevi Jalebiwala! The best jalebiwala in Mumbai! If you are looking for amazing, fresh, crispy and perfect sweet Jalebi, this is the place. Jalebiwala is a good place to start your mornings or to end your evenings! A good traditional aroma and flavour catches you, if you are passing the shop. Most delicious and mouth watering fresh Jalebi's in pure ghee! They cook jalebi after the order is placed and serve hot and fresh jalebi. It’s nice to watch the procedure of making of Jalebi's. Mostly a take away joint, you can still stand and eat, if you don’t want the jalebi to go cold by even one bit. Awesome hot jalebi's anytime you visit this shop. They also serve a savoury gujarati snack dish called Papdi along with Papaya chutney, but it would have been icing on the cake if they also serve Fafda (another savoury gujarati snack dish) and pickled green chillies. Be ready to stand in a queue on a Sunday morning or on special occasions. The bad part is you have to wait for long time and they do not have a proper set up so you can wait, sit, and enjoy the garma-garam sweet Jalebi’s. But they still carry the legendary taste of Jalebi's! No point in caring about the ambience so much. Overall a good place, for your taste buds if you are a Jalebi lover! It's totally worth the money! Must try!|positive
Rated One of the best jalebis in mumbai! This place hardly ever lets you down. They follow a standard process to make jalebis throughout all their branches across Mumbai. Thus anywhere you go their jalebi tastes pretty much the same. They also serve papdi and papaya chutney along with it. Papdi is decent, we definitely can find better. Sometime back they used to keep the jalebis ready and cooked. They just used to pack it as per the order. These days they have started preparing jalebis as per the order. That prevents jalebis from getting cold and soggy. One downside about this specific, unlike the one in Pydhonie, is that it does not have sitting area. So it gets very difficult to eat your jalebis there and you have to take a parcel.|positive
Rated The place has Jalebi's and Fafda. That's it. But to try and describe the Jalebi is to do injustice... The right amount of sweet and absolutely piping hot is how we had it. Yum!|positive
Rated Paradise for gujju in mumbai. When ever m near Zaveri Bazar or close to this shop I make sure I drop ther for pipping hot fresh papdi gathiya with pure ghee saffron flavoured jalebi. What else gujju needs|positive
Rated Well, this place is very small but the food here is very good. Speaking about the ambience... On one of the walls all healthy food/fruits are described and also the ceiling is lined by the glasses in upside down direction...so overall its ambience is ok. The service was slow but it was worth waiting fr these desserts. We had order vanilla brownie shake, kulfi falooda with rabdi and one mre dessert( having chocolate and brownie srry i dnt remember the name) Well vanilla brownie shake was just too good and it was very much refreshing. Falooda was also good with proper amount of rabdi and kulfi. But i felt the quantity was less as one would expect from the prices. Choc and brownie dessert was good but not as good as falooda nd shake. Well the place is bit overpriced and also there are less varieties to choose frm. So overall ill rate it 4/5|positive
Rated I had tried this Singapore Carnival Sundae Speacility of the Carnival Icecreams. Looks Super ; we were bound to order due to the Looks. The Service was a bit Slow but looking at the Sundae you forget the World. Pieaces of Strawberry ; Kiwi ; Apple were mixed with Whippedcream to perfection. But the surprise was the 3 layered scooped icecream of Strawberry ; Mango and Vanilla. It is just the perfect blend of Fruits and Fruit Icecream. Coming to pricing it was Rs 230 for the whole while was a bit bigg compared to the Size of the Glass :) but will surely recommend to go for it ☺|positive
Rated Small and adorable place order strawberry blossom taste was awesome want to try more .|positive
Rated We ordered a choco sitafal cream which is supposed to be a mix of many things. I was not expecting something nice, as I felt that the two flavours would not blend in nicely. But to my surprise, it was greattt! Amazing place for desserts! Will surely visit them again! Place is a little expensive, but it is worth it. Deserves a 5 star rating!|positive
Rated This is a small place right next to On the Go veg lounge, mainly for desserts and juices, etc. The staff is friendly. We ordered the 'Singapore' and were as amused with the outcome as with the name. It took some time to be prepared but was really amazing with tons of fruits and nuts topped with cream. The other options in the menu were as mouth watering. Visit this place if u have a sugar craving!! thefoodiebattle.wordpress.com|positive
Rated This is a great place if u wanna have some good desserts as they have lot of options from juices, Shakes, sundaes and many more. I ordered Blackgrape shake, brownie sip and malai kulfi. Taste wise a big thumps up, service is fast and staff is attentive. Would definitely recommend others.|positive
Rated A tiny ice-cream parlour next to On The Go Veg Lounge. Carnival serves you Ice-creams, Mocktails, Juices, ice-cream sundaes, Milkshakes and Kulfis! Tried the Chocolate Chip ice-cream and Mango ice-cream here. Yet to try the other sections. As far as the ice-cream is concerned, it was fresh and creamy with Mango ice-cream being the best out of the two! Looking forward to come back to this place to try out their other sections! :) Ambience: 3.5/10 Taste: 4/5 Value for Money: 4.5/5 Service: 5/5. mumbaifoodjunkieblog.wordpress.com|positive
Rated A tiny but lovely place for juice, shakes and sundaes. The mocktails and deserts are mouth watering and lovely to taste. All thngs are garnished beautifully and the prices are reasonable too.|positive
Rated I write a review again for this place.....a small shop located in bylanes of Borivali......i had ordered choc muffins for bday and believe me the mouth watering melting taste is splendid......cake star i ll come n order again....keep up the taste and do start an outlet in other parts of mumbai|positive
Rated Ambiance: NA Quality: 4/5 VFM: 4/5 I was once walking by the street where i had seen this joint open a few months ago and curiosity killed the cat! I had to g and have a look. Chaitanya is the one who owns the joint and he was there when i went to have the peek a boo. He invited me in and i was just looking around. We had a nice chat and then he offered me the mini cupcakes. I loved them so much that I took some home and also came back with friends. Then I ordered a minion cake to be made in a day. And he got it made to the mark. The cake was a fondant cake of which i have this perception that they just look nice but are not so nice to have. Well he changed that. However the fondant was, the cake was amazingly soft from the inside. Then I had a birthday of my friend coming up and I ordered for Cupcakes which were filled inside. So the flavors were the red velvet cupcake with cream cheese filling and the chocolate nutella cupcake. Both were good but the nutella one could have been better.|positive
Rated My Baby was turning two and I wanted to order a birthday cake for him. I was bored of Monginis and Birdy's & wanted to try someone new. I found Cake Star very close to my place. I found their cakes pretty descent looking.. so decided to place an order with them. I do not like cream cakes and as I wanted for my son.. I was looking for a dark chocolate cake. They gave me two choices.. death by chocolate and chocolate truffle. They said death by chocolate contains coffee. I don't really enjoy coffee desserts so was not sure about it. They offered me a pastry to taste and then decide. Death by Chocolate was yummy! No coffee flavor at all. Was soft and moist! I placed an order for it. Meanwhile I also tried the red velvet pastry. It was soft and moist too but a little sweet for my palate. The final Birthday cake was awesome. Soft and moist... not too sweet... just perfect. Just the way I wanted it to be. Everyone loved it. Definitely a good place to order cakes.|positive
Rated Ordered my daughter's 1st birthday cake from this amazing place. It was a custom cake design selected from Internet n these guys knocked it out of the park. Exact carbon copy of the design n taste wise it was heaven. Fondant cake never tasted this good. A must visit place for every special occasion. Customer service awesome. Great job Mr. Chaitanya n team �?|positive
Rated Okay... I've tried only 2 things so far.. Pineapple pastry and Chocolate muffin. But the high rating because both shot through the roof as far my expectations of taste and pricing were concerned. Chocolate muffins are like 4 bites of heaven.. Love love loved it! (although you could eat it in a single bite :p) Also it's a veggie outlet and that removes a lot pruning effort! Plus points for the sweet and considerate service. I was surely re-visit and try other items :)|positive
Rated Amazing taste of pastries and cup cakes.. reasonably priced... mouth watering cakes... they also provide customized cakes.... one must try their cup cakes... also loved chocolate pastry.|positive
Rated I have actually tried i think almost everything :p I yesterday gmhad a craving for chocolate badly as usual and thought of trying the red velvet as it appeared tempting and ohhh my GOD it was amaaazing! I really really loved it! I usually dont prefer red velvet but this wasss amazzinngg!!|positive
Rated superb cakes beautifully designed as per your requirement and reasonably priced. I ordered a 3D cake for my husband' s birthday; 1st time from this shop and was very happy with it. No disappointment 😀. Thank you Cake Star!!|positive
Rated The cup cakes are a must try. The flavours are vivid and the Colors are vibrant. Each flavour is distinguished and made to perfection. Overall it's a gratifying experience. Also it's a perfect gift for someone you might want to see with a sweet little goodie.|positive
Rated Something we wanted nr my house and this shop gives lot of varities of cakes and quality is also good... Its in same range they give personalised cake so i would like to advice u go to this cake shop n make some good peronalised cake and taste ......|positive
Rated Naturals of prem nagar Borivli is one of the well known ice cream parlour in borivli.. Naturals provides a variety of ice cream flavours.. Have tried tender coconut, choco cream and chocolate almond from here and all of them tasted really good.. Ambience here is also good and space is also good.. Overall a good ice cream parlour and must try during hot summer...|positive
Rated Desire for a Perfect ice cream ? This is it then! Natural ice cream the name is really true...as they serve really natural flavors of ice cream ! My favorite: Tender Coconut.|positive
Rated Every one can vouch for natural ice cream chain. The recently introduced berry variety is nice. Especially cranberry. But the cake is taken away by black grapes which is surprisingly delicious.|positive
Rated Another outlet of naturals India's best ice cream brand. Must say they are the owner of this master piece. You will fall in love with naturals after testing any of their signature flavors. My parsonal favorite is the tender coconut.|positive
Rated Do we really need a review for this one? Best ice creams in Mumbai. And plethora of flavors to choose from. Tender coconut and mango are my all time favourites. They even introduced Shrikhand flavored ice cream as well. Interesting, eh?|positive
Rated Naturals!!! Famous for fruit flavors. This naturals have good amount of space. Indoor as well as outdoor comparative to other naturals. Recommended: Mango, sitphal, tender coconut, muskmelon. Non recommended: Thandai nd some pan flavor|positive
Rated I have been This naturals outlet since childhood, quite spacious The seating is good enough and also air conditioned ,compared to kora kendra branch in which only the ice cream n staff sits in A.C room. Tender coconut and choco chips r the best ones Naturals quality is the one by which u won't get any viral cold but only good taste.|positive
Rated This is my favourite ice cream joint. They serves really nice varieties of ice creams. Tender coconut and sitafal are my favourites. Must recommended|positive
Rated Now this is some evergreen stuff.. Ice creams made here have been one of the favorites since childhood for most of the people.. #mango #sitaphal #choco chip. Can make you feel you're in heaven. :D|positive
Rated Amazing flavours! This outlet is quite spacious as well. Standard taste maintained as the name suggests. Good hangout place for anyone with the sweet tooth. Chocobite and roasted almonds for me is the best.|positive
Rated Been here yesterday, its in the open terrace with the roof top concept, but wasn't hot at all as it was breezy and near the sea.. Ambience is too good but the sitting chair is not comfortably placed. They have appointed many employees, so the service was good and quick. Talking about the food it was average just like any other restaurant... But is highly price may be bcoz of the ambience and place.|positive
Rated Ambience of the restaurant is different ..... U can enjoy the food on the roof top with Royal Feel. Food is tasty. If you are going in group than order Bread basket in which you will get diff types of Breads. Taste is awesone|positive
Rated What can I say... rooftop open to the stars and a cool summer breeze from the Arabian Sea is the perfect setting and that's all. Go there to enjoy the ambience ... service is too slow and the food is just about OK. Don't try any of the fish... too dry and definitely not fresh. Virgin mojito goes well and the tandoori mushrooms are good. Chicken tandoori starters are also cooked dry and chewy. The entrance is definitely not great and with booze missing on the menu it is a bit of a let down given the ambience. Nice family place. Worth the ambience though... have food at Bademiya's close by 😊|positive
Rated Great North Indian cuisine in a fantastic open air roof top garden setting. Pros: -The tandoori prawns were large and cooked nicely in a spicy dressing. The chicken do pyaza was prepared in a nice thick sauce packed with flavour and the garlic naan was light for a naan and not too greasy. - The dining area is set in a roof top garden with views over Colaba and the Arabian sea, which makes for a very pleasant dining atmosphere. - Each table is set under its own curtained frame, giving a sense of secluded privacy. - Excellent service from staff. Cons: - Fairly expensive, but you are paying for the setting|positive
Rated Got fascinated with this place ever since I saw the ambience on Zomato. So, I planned to visit here on Valentines this year with my friends and to our surprise it was way too crowded. Luckily we got a table after few hours and the wait was absolutely worth it. From the ambience to the food, every thing about this place has a great touch of our culture. It's a must visit guys :)|positive
Rated After a long wait, finally been to this place..a nice place in south Mumbai.. The ambiance is perfect, it gives u a perfect view of South Mumbai with cool breeze...reservation is recommended|positive
Rated Koyla is surely synonymous with the word ambience. You get breathtaking view of Arabian Sea,TAJ and skyline of colaba in a single frame. Cool breeze in the evening adds to the aesthetic appeal of this outlet. They do not serve alcohol and have separate seating area for hookah lovers. Food here mainly boasts of Indian and tandoori items. CHEESE KULCHA is the standout dish and unique than any other outlets. NAWABI PANEER Tikka is another veg dish to lookout for. Overall food was sumptuous. In mocktails section, Berry Blast was amazing while lemon grass cooler being the least liked. Most of the ratings goes for the ambience and the location with the rest go for the seating and cheese KULCHA. One of the best romantic places to go in South Bombay if you are hitched. Cheers!!|positive
Rated Best part that makes this resto perfect is all about its ambience.Ambience is just indeed great!Service is also good.Atmosphere of this place makes you feel relaxed.It is the one of best hotels to visit again and again!Food is also too good!This place is oftenly crowded so its better if you do the reservations.Do visit this place!|positive
Rated Amazing... Taste wise and service wise amazing simply amazing... The seating is an issue as there isn't any place to sit there. But the food is a complete value for money. I'd highly recommend the burnt garlic mayo sauce|positive
Rated Well, after hearing a lot of about this place, I came here today! It is surprising that I never knew this place existed on the main road, although I come to phoenix almost 3-4 times in a week. My bad actually! So let me start with it. The person making the rolls, didn't seem like the normal cook you see on roadside outlets. This man was educated, spoke English, knew about the menu and very very well behaved. On asking I can to know that he was the owner. Well, one of the best things about people who are passionate about their work is that they are open to criticism and want to improve. I had the normal chicken roll and I liked it. Although, it could be better. There was a little more sauce than I prefer but that's fine. Taste was good. Will I come here again? Yes. I want to try out the garlic burnt chicken roll because the man himself suggested me that.|positive
Rated Amazingly too good, be it simple rolls to burnt garlic chicken rolls, they are just tempting enough to make you come back again, must try place just opposite to phoenix mall|positive
Rated I was low on cash, was really hungry and wanted to order something. I came across kathi kebab roll and it looked decent and very cheap so ordered 2 rolls. I ordered the chicken burnt garlic mayo roll which was decent. I found it a little sweet. The other one was the kolkatta roll which was spicy. The size of the roll was pretty big and it was very filling. The taste was fine overall. Will have to try some more rolls and see. The bill came to 210 for 2 rolls.|positive
Rated Though this outlet has nothing to offer by way of ambience or comfort, what it does provide is very polite and prompt service and a large variety of potato, paneer, egg and chicken rolls. The recommended rolls also have 'Wow' written beside them on the menu, so you don't have to spend much time pondering over it. The burnt garlic mayonnaise roll was delicious in every bite, and the mayonnaise sauce had a smoothness and a burst of taste that is difficult to come by in a roll. In contrast, the aloo Kolkata roll didn't have too much of taste or smoothness in it, and was a tad too dry. Also, it surely did not justify the use of the name 'Kolkata roll' as rolls in Kolkata are definitely much more delicious than the aloo roll served. While I wouldn't mind trying the other chicken rolls they offer, I would definitely advise them to work on improving their aloo rolls.|positive
Rated Kathi Kabab Rolls is a place that me and my friends accidentally chanced upon while finding our way to the Todi mill compound. We were exceedingly famished and so we finally decided to have a snack at this place before moving on. I ordered a normal chicken roll with egg. Whilst the Frankie was being prepared the kind lady at the counter told me to review them on Zomato! I was quite surprised. This was a first where a small roadside shack had presence on Zomato! We got the order within 5 minutes and it was simply delectable to say the least! The Chicken pieces were plenty and the other sauces/ingredients seemed fresh unlike the other Frankie joints. The chicken was well cooked and tender. The overall hygiene of the place too seemed acceptable. Ratings: Food: 4/5 Ambience: 2/5 Service: 3.5/5 Value for money: 4/5 Overall, KKR impressed me very much. Probably one of the best Frankies in Mumbai. Only downside is the location. Will come back to try other frankies for sure! Cheers :)|positive
Rated After a long time, found a place that sells brilliant rolls. Had the chicken burnt garlic mayo roll and for a change the burnt garlic wasn't on the menu just for fun, one can actually taste the garlic in the roll, something that doesn't happen at other places. Looking forward to visit again and trying new stuff.|positive
Rated It was famaous for rolls. We thought to give a try to it. So we went in evening at this place around 7pm. No crowd at that time. Ordered Chicken Burnt Garlic Mayo rolls it was great.|positive
Rated *Short Review* This place is bang opposite chawpatty and very close to charni road station. This place serves some really amazing shakes, juices and creams. Love their chic choc milkshake. It dense, freezing cold and amazing at taste. If you are a chocokate lover dont missout on this shake. They have some really amazing creams like strawberry cream, mango cream etc. They have good pizzas and sandwichs as well. And the best part about thi place is its open till late night, like usually i visit this place when i go for a night drive or for clubbing. This place is open till 2am aprox on weekends and is hell crowded. It usually takes 1 hr for us to get our order at night. One of the most famous spots of mumbai this place is. Must tryyy place this is!!!|positive
Rated This place is right opposite chowpatty u cn identify with the car queue besides it where so many ppl enjoy their icecreams... we have tried their roased almond and roasted cadbury they have lot of variety and lot of crowd on weekends... their service is nice as they bring it to u and u dont hv to wait in the crowd tats the best part...if u want a late night ice cream u hv to visit here they r open till 2am sumtimes... so nvr miss an icecream at midnight.. with so many flavors nt tried their milkshakes so il recommend it only for ice cream|positive
Rated I think every Bombayite has spent the Entire college times here. Gem of city on very trendy place. Can't miss. Decent food open till late. Park eat move.|positive
Rated Couldn't believe tht Mumbaikars can be so foodie even at midnight 2am until I visited "Bachelorrs".....suggested n as said by my frnds, its actually d best place to visit especially wen pizzas n shakes r calling u late nite.....I seriously had d best pizza ever!!!! Freshly made huge size just perfect to fill ur tummy n heart full....|positive
Rated Bachelorr's truly had the best strawberry cream and sandwich that I have had in a long time! It's astonishing how small roadside joints like bachelorr's can ever be missed by people visiting Mumbai! A must visit place in Mumbai!|positive
Rated This place is fast food joint,over a period of years it's lost it's charm !! Bachelors is known for late nite eat outs ...I have tried their ice creams - any day naturals is better than them Pizza - decent ..lots of varieties but again pricey and not worth Only thing I liked v much is panner tikka starter which they serve hot n spicy it's the only saving grace ! But me travelling from juhu to town for bachelors --no ways !!|positive
Rated One of the most popular food joint on marine drive, which is open till wee hours. Everything is amazing here whether grill sandwiches or ice creams or famous shakes or even pizzas. Whenever we decide to have night out at marine drive, one stop at bachelor's is always must! Will surely recommend it..|positive
Rated Good place with quality Mediterranean food. We tried the chicken shawarma with extra cheese and the garlic hummus. The food was reasonable and tasty. The staff is friendly but the seating space is very cramped and in adequate. The service is quick and doesn't keep you waiting for long hours. As a student, I'd been here many a times because of its pocket friendly prices and prompt food preparation. Ambience: 3/5 Service: 4.5/5 Food: 4/5 Price: 4/5|positive
Rated A good late night place to eat. Very very small place and lot of people just pick parcels. Lucky, if you get a place to sit during weekends!! Had been here after a long time and tried shawarma. All I can say is I was pretty disappointed - undercooked and no taste at all.|positive
Rated Have eaten Shawrma from Maroosh many times but it was the first time I tried their Chicken biryani and Reshmi Kebab....the biryani was very flavourful and the kebabs were soft and juicy. If you are on budget and wanna have yummy food this is the place to go. 500₹ is all u need for 2 people.|positive
Rated Tucked away in the corner or high Street Phoenix and gelato. Offers open sitting and takeaways. The menu is limited but the food is sumptuous. The Indian includes daal, paneer with roti, naan and kulcha. They also have shwarma and rolls. Good for quick meal but had open sitting and expect the food to be high on calorie. Overall the price and taste scores. Would definitely visit again when in Phoenix for a change from other luxury dine ins|positive
Rated This joint of MM!Maroosh at pheonix is more like a road side stall with no ambience to speak of. I usually go to Burger king whenever I am in high street pheonix but this time I headed to Maroosh to try their shawarmas. I called for classic chicken shwarma and chicken bhuna roll.Since the shwarmas were highly priced I expected them to be something different than your regular shwarmas. But to my surprise,they were just like what you get at road side shwarma vendors. No garlic sauce/mayo or pickled beets served alongside.. nothing at all. Chicken bhuna roll was tasty�?|positive
Rated Maroosh is my all time fav joint for shawarma. Good to see that they have come up with variety of shawarma and and new spicy orange sauce. It's always been more of like a take away joint so I usually prefer to order for office and it never disappoints. The main courses like chickentikka masala, mutton curry and the biryani are one of my favs here.|positive
Rated Donno why, but although I don't expect it, whenever I need a quick bite and walk into this place for a shawarma, barbecue or gravy, they surpass my expectations.. So this time, me and my better half enjoyed a late night bite at 11:00 pm in a quiet Phoenix Mills with a lovely breeze and only a few cozy couples lazing about.. The butter chicken and Naan was mouth watering only stopped my my over expanding belt button.. Job well done, I say :))|positive
Rated I tried Maroosh for the first time recently and I was impressed with the taste of its rolls. The service was fast and efficient. However I was not sure how they ensure that the veg food in their kitchen interacts with the non veg food, specially the knifes and other equipments - this might be a concern for some veg people. Also the seating is exactly where people pass by continously and that is a little annoying when you are eating. Food 4/5 Ambience 2/5 Service 4/5 Value for Money 4/5|positive
Rated Falafels are decent. I usually do a an online order with maroosh when I dont want to think about what to eat. Dal and Reshmi parantha are also good for a single person. Have heard the place is much better for non vegetarians. Considering this is a QSR and not a fancy restaurant, they do a good job with whatever small menu they have.|positive
Rated Amazing rolls! The quantity of gravy is pretty less! Its a small joint at phoenix , for handy food or take away quick bite , its a good deal!|positive
Rated Wok express really has to improve its ordering and delivery mechanism. For a wok place to deliver food after 1.5 hours is unacceptable. Placed the order thru Zomato, had ordered the mushroom bao but then got a call later saying that it wasn't available. Now for the food, had ordered a large wok with spicy garlic sauce and an eggplant bao. The food was cold, flat noodles over cooked and stuck together. The sauce was OK but a little oily. The bao was better than the wok, the filling was nice. Overall a bad experience, they need to improve a lot.|positive
Rated Ambience : nothing to rave about, Contrary slightly cramped. Veg wok : yummmmm ;) the spicy coriander sauce is incredible. Wasabi prawns : very avoidable. Lacked taste. Great for home delivery as well.|positive
Rated Oooo yummy and economical for a nice Chinese craving. I ordered a medium box of flat wheat noodles with kung pao sauce with a few different veggies and double the chicken with burnt onions, burnt garlic, crushed peanuts topping. I absolutely loved every bite of it. Good bits-the topping of burnt yummy deliciousness with sooooo much chicken. Loved it!!!! Room for improvement-very less veggies. I'm a meat lover all the way but there always has to be a balance in all the flavours. Overall-good quantity, fast delivery and nicely flavoured goodness in a box. P.S. I honestly was dying for a fortune cookie but I got none (maybe because my order was just for one box-thats bias but anyway.) Very upset because its not only about the fortune in it but I actually genuinely love the cookie as well. Oh and ya the chopsticks were hopeless pieces of paper light wood and can be used for absolutely nothing. I was worried it would snap and ruin my noodles so I just used mine from home.|positive
Rated Nice quirky place to sit. Normal good quality food. Taste is not anything extravagant but descent enough to have. Reco- Kung pao sauce in any noodles & lemon ice tea|positive
Rated Went there today with high expectations after listening about this place from friends,I ordered a large veg wok with flat noodles but all the vegetables were not present, then I ordered the ice cream which was in the menu but not in this outlet then I tried another ice cream after all this I orderd the ice tea which was real good . Talking about the ambience it is very small but looks decent and beautiful .|positive
Rated One of the many places offering customised woks. It is a little over priced for the quality and quantity of the woks. Other items on their menu are good.|positive
Rated Weekend take-away: Reviews (each out of 5) based on Food, Ambiance, Staff/ Service and Suggestions Any! 1- DESSERT (4.5/5):: - After Nine Pastry: EXCELLENT: Inspired by After Eight Chocolate (Mint & Chocolate Blends). After nine has a white mint smooth fondant center that is surrounded by a dark chocolate cake! Gooey & Yummy! - Dutch Truffle: GOOD: The call it the classic chocolate cake!- Quantity wise, they serve medium palm sized square pastries - Chocolate Overload Brownie: VERY GOOD: Crusty outside and gooey inside!! Absolutely yummy! - Oreo Brownie: GOOD: Similar to chocolate overload but with Oreo biscuits filled in it! 2- AMBIANCE (3.5/5):: - Tiny Take away kinda place. I am calling it tiny because there are so many people coming to this place that there was no place to sit! Well, I understand why - It is that yummy! I ordered a take away though :) - Comfortable seating for four available- Located close to the Colaba Market, making it easy for shoppers to drop dead shopping and then before they get hypoglycemic, they can visit this perfect spot to consume some sugar for the body! - Gets too noisy due to overcrowding at times - The preparation and storage area looked clean! 3- STAFF & SERVICE (4.0/5):: - Well behaved, well mannered - Quick Service 4. SUGGESTIONS (3.5/5):: - Seating Arrangements can be worked on so that more people can consume right there instead of taking it away! - I saw certain varieties/options in coffee. How about making some tea too? - Improve the take away packing. The Oreo brownie was crushed because it was packed with the chocolate overload! Goodbye Yet? - Nope!|positive
Rated I am surprised i have not written a review of Theo's so far. I've been visiting Theo's since its first day. I remember the chocolate balls that were all I could afford back then as a student. I loved the mousse cakes and brownies (I hated the banoffee - t'was my dislike for banana not the actual cake in that case). The snacks are a welcome surprise. I'm a sucker for the cream cheese Danish and the chutney bread. Post 9 pm, there is a buy one get one free offer, which is actually a lot to take home. Recently, I've begun to appreciate their sugar free cake, which is perfect for diabetics with a sweet tooth.|positive
Rated Keep going here for desserts time and again and NEVER have the desserts here disappointed me ever! This is a real sweet tooth heaven and a classic example of how sticking to what you do best can really make you a specialist! Their rainbow cake is a beauty, so so pretty and so delicious!! Their brownies are to die for!!! The cupcakes are the best I have ever tasted and their Red velvet deserves a standing ovation. If there is one thing that I do cut points for at this outlet specifically is the sometimes rude man at the cash counter! Take a bow Messman family! This is almost like service to the society! thefoodauror.blogspot.com|positive
Rated Best brownies This was the first store before they became popular and expanded to multiple outlets. (If I'm not mistaken) A box of theobroma brownies was the best gift you could get at that time. The Chocolate overload, millionaire, Oreo and red velvet being one of the best They're dessert being popular as well. The baked Philadelphia cheesecake is yumm. To eat. You must try the 'chip butty'. It's the best thing ever. It's like a burger. Only instead of the patty it comes with fries. Add some eggs and beacon and you'll reach a whole new world of flavour. Definitely should try it|positive
Rated The place is located at the end of the cosway and is a small one (like hardly 3-4 tables for sitting). It serves the BEST brownie that I have ever had. They not only have 1 or 2 but almost 10-12 varieties of brownies. And almost all of them are Amazing! A must try is their Overload and Red velvet.|positive
Rated A delectable array of cakes & confectionaries fresh from the oven. Always thronging with customers & a small rush around the counter. My personal favourite on Causeway though, is Celejor, when value for money is the criteria.|positive
Rated Reaching Theo post 9 pm is like trying your luck to get the best of cakes / pastries / breads / brownies . Buy 1 get one free on most of the bakery stuff and there is rush . Managed to get a mawa cake though which i will have it later but got some Opium Cake (classic geonise filled with chocolate ream) it is yum .. Must have when at theo. Opera was a another one which i got my hands on ... chocolate ganache , coffee , butter cream and almond sponge - amazing . Cheese biscuits - good Biscotti -to be had with chai - good Paneer Chittinand sandwich - very good Theo's is always a great place pre or post dinner or lunch be it any of the branches , they have maintained the standard . Keep it up !! prithvishashar.wordpress.com|positive
Rated Theobroma is located exactly next to MOD. I personally don't like this place but my sister loves the red velvet out here. it seems to me that the red velvet out here abit different in taste ans it's overpriced also. Celejor is a better option i feel.|positive
Rated Drawing inspiration from the streets of Mumbai in each and every essence of the place is a mighty view of sigh. Be it the décor, backside of the uniform or the menu it is just a marvelous compilation of work. One look at the menu and you will have laugh of your life, the interesting manner in which the dishes are named will get make u laugh for a couple of minutes for sure. Coming to food, there are more hits then misses. My top picks would be: (You will know why I said laugh of the life) Tu Cheese Badi Hai Mast Mast: In all literal sense the Cheese was badi mast, crisp cracker topped with cheese bhurji made with varieties of cheese with seasoning. GOOOD! Chitthi Ayi Hai: Panner parcels (chitthi) wrapped in roomali roti served with waldrof salad. Ummmmm DELICIOUS! Garma Garam Pav: Mumbai’s famous masala pav on a sizzling platter served with minute grinned bhaji. It had strong flavor of bhaji masala. If you are a masala pav lover then a must try for you. Cheese Chilli Pakoda: This is our classic bread pakoda with chatni and cheese as a stuffing. The dish is finished with chat masala dusted on the warm pakodas. The Tiffin Box: Before I start this one was FANTASTIC and had high VFM, the tiffin box was again literally a tiffin box (inspired by the dabbawalas of Mumbai). This consisted of spicy Paneer Kadai, Tadkewali Dal, crisp Reshmi Paratha, Jeera Rice, Papad and Salad. This in itself is a meal for two. JUST SUPER! Chole Te Bhatture: Served on a mini cycle is a wonderful sight, the kale chole deliciously prepared served with warm bhatture will make you relive a memory of good chole. Paan Pasand: The best drink on the menu. Refreshing! With strong flavor of Paan and minute pieces of gulkand makes it a wonderful drink. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED Jalebi Bai: Jalebi sandwich stuffed with kesar and pistachio flavoured cream cheese, topped with dryfruit fudge. JUST GREAT. Things I didn’t enjoy much: B2B – Bombay meets Bangkok Say Cheeze Shanghai Knights and Chinatown Pizza – Pizza’s are a strict no for this place. Chocolate Thali – Way too hyped, there is nothing extraordinary about this only the sheer variety. The thali consist of chocolate khakhara, Shrikhand, Fudge, Balls, Lollipop, Mousse and Dip. So my end take on this place is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Go enjoy the great flavours and the Mumbai touch. fooodgalli.wordpress.com|positive
Rated No one wants to eat plain boring food nowadays. We want twists to normal food, fusions, combinations never heard before and we are always looking for something new.New, which is pleasing to the eyes as well as taste buds. Enter- Desiklub. A venture from the owners of Quattros, this place gives your normal desi food a modern twist. A pure vegetarian place situated at the tip of Mumbai, the interiors are quite ‘Bambaiya’. But actually the songs that are played here give you the feels.90’s tracks playing give you major nostalgia and quite frankly, I loved it.Tu cheez badi hai mast mast over Taylor Swift, any day ;) The mood was set right with the songs on a Sunday afternoon.One look in the menu, and I was amused. Not only is their song selection unique, their menu is also one of its kind. Hot as hell outside, we started with ICE CREAM SODAS. Both looked pretty as a picture.The MANGO DUET was such a delight! With a mango lolly, it made the inner child in me so happy.LITCHI ROSE with a lollipop and ice cream became extra sweet. The litchi flavor was minimal and not the best drink to try out here. With these, we ordered HEALTH BHI, TASTE BHI, which was a sprouts based chaat.An edible potato basket covering a chaat which was- sprouts, tangy yogurt, pomegranate, onion and sev.If not great, this was certainly a good start to our meal. It was quite healthy with minimal fats with loads of sprouts. Health freaks- here you go! Next what we had, I ordered purely on the basis of the name. How many times do you see menu and read a dish called – ‘TU CHEESE BADI HAI MAST MAST’?Instant order of this by yours truly.As the name suggests, it was a bhurji made with 2-3 types of cheese on top of a cheese cracker. You call this ‘cheesy’😛Too much cheese. Had their been some chutney served with it, I guess it would have been better. Next came, a not so healthy Samosa chaat called ‘TASTE KA KUAN’. An edible basket filled with samosa chaat. A little spicy to my taste, but nonetheless, it was chaat�?�With samosa, yogurt, chaat fillings and lots of sev.Fit for at least 2-3 people, this could be your pick in the appetizers. In between, I ordered, what came as a recommendation from the staff- MASALA SOYSO.As a child, ever had this drink called- Mirchina? So basically cold drink that got a touch a masala. Better off a digestion drink than a between meals drink. But, let me tell you, it was refreshing as hell!It was served in a skull shaped vessel. Creepy, but when content is good, who cares? Now comes the dish which combines my two loves- Pizza and Pav bhaji.The PAV BHAJI PIZZA here was superb! With pizza base topped with generous amount of pav bhaji and topped with cheese ( they didn’t shy away by adding truck load of cheese)Before serving, sprinkled some finely chopped onions and there you have. Definitely a winner! Next dish came cycling in, literally!The CHOLE TE BHATURE was served in quite a unique way. Loved the presentation! Mini Bhaturas in the back seat, chole in the carry on and main seat given to vinegar soaked onions.Now being a Jain- Punjabi, I’ve had the most authentic Chole, and these were more on the taste of ‘Bambaiya Chole’ . And I wasn’t convinced on the price point of this particular dish. THE TIFFIN BOX was a unanimous choice as the next dish. They brought a huge ass tiffin box on the table. It opened up to Paneer sabji, Tadka dal, rice, Roomali roti ( you are given a choice of bread when you order) papad, yogurt based salad and onions.We loved the dal and paneer sabji ( I loved the dal more) Perfect for one person. I have no complains with this one. Finally after devouring all this, we made our way to the last course of the meal, DESSERTS! First came – Triple layered dessert.Lauki ka halwaCream cheeseBoondi Looked somewhat like an Indian flag and very pleasing to the eyes. But was it pleasing to the taste buds? Not actually. Too sweet and the together did not create any magic. Lauki ka Halwa individually was better than the other two layers. The last but not the least of ALASKAN DELIGHT, which was a cookie dough ice-cream sandwich.Ice cream sandwiched between choco chip cookie dough, covered with chocolate and sprinkles. One word- DELIGHTFUL!Loved every bite of this heavenly dessert, and I would suggest you to try this apart the Chocolate Thali. If you are a vegetarian and love twist in your food, Desiklub could be your pick.And don’t forget to groove on the music played here. Real stress buster :D Happy eating :)|positive
Rated A very interesting place with fantastic fusion of Desiklub Street food and international twist. Very high on presentation- that is the highlights of this place. Decor gives glimpse of vintage Bombay. On the foods - right from drinks, starters, appetizers, main course and desserts - everything was pretty impressive. We tried as many items as possible - few of them - Jeera Masala, Ganna-Pineapple, Bubblegum, Ginger spice and Mango duet - every drink was pretty good. Starters name pretty impressive and taste equally good. Main course - Bombay style Pulao, Garma Garam Masala Pav, Pizza, Chole Bhature were very tasty indeed. Sizzling Brownie with two sauces also had some twist. Overall nice experience and good service from Harshad and Navin of the restaurant.|positive
Rated A new offering from the group that has served awesome All - Veg food through Quattro, Spice Klub and The Rolling Pin, had us all charged up. The word 'Chat' (Indian Street Food) itself gets us all excited, and knowing how good they are with fusion, we reached there after reserving a table. After settling down on our respective chairs within this quite a casual..exuberant space, we were ready to order some hatke (hindi for unusal) drinks. Before we go ahead, just to inform you, the only alcohol they serve here is beer..since chakna (snacks / ) & chat goes very well with beer. We chose to go Shareef (by that we mean Non-Alcoholic) that day so chose Pineapple Ganna, Pista Kesari Badam and Pan Pasand Ice Cream Soda and Bubblegum Energy Drink. Although they tasted awesome especially Bubblegum Energy Drink, Pan Pasand Float and Pista Kesari Badam, they were way too sweet then needed. For starters we ordered Mathiya Tacos, Papad Bhel and Dab-elly (Dabeli). As against our doubt Mathiya Tacos were not at all sweet and superbly tasty. Hit with all of us. Dabeli was perfectly yummy. Both of these dishes were noteworthy and Delicious. Papad Bhel was as good as any other Bhel but way too spicy for people who enjoy spicy food. By then we were already full as their portions are quite big so we chose to order only one main course, which was Do Dil Mil Rahein hai with an instruction to not make it spicy. As soon as we had eaten the first bite of this unusual dish we were extremely happy. Perfectly cooked and exceptionally tasty. Knowing how sweet their drinks were, we were skeptical of ordering Desserts but took the courage of ordering Jalebi Bai and Brownie with hot chocolate and caramel sauce. Bloody hell! Both the desserts were sinful...yummy and perfectly tasty. A perfect end to a perfect meal. Mango Mousse between the Jalebis and the perfectly sweet caramel sauce in the Brownie were the hero of their respective dishes. Hospitality is Top-Notch. There is nothing to complain about when it comes to service. Definitely returning to try other Unusual stuff very soon. P.S. - A place to binge on Indian Street Food with-a-twist for all those, including foreigners, with sensitive tummy.|positive
Rated ABOUT THE PLACE DesiKlub - An all vegetarian offering from the stable of Quattro, SpiceKlub and Rolling pin, and the impressive pedigree made sure my expectations were quite high. More so, as the concept of this place looks to bring the universally loved street food to a fine dine (sort of) space, accompanied by a twist. Playing with streetfood is always fraught with danger. These are the tastes most of us have grown up and have strong associations with. The street food vendors are artists in their own right, and replicating the taste is an almighty challenge. Did the outlet live upto its positioning. Short Answer – NO. Read on to find out why . AMBIANCE & SERVICE The place is interestingly done up. Funky interiors with a view to mimic an actual street setting, with walls adorned with full sized posters of Mumbai streets with the legendary Kaali Peeli, a car bonnet at one end etc. The chairs we sat on had names of famous Mumbai railway stations and streets on the back, to create an informal feel. So far, so good. The service too, was reasonably good. The serving staff was prompt, and considering we were an office group of about 15 people, they were quite attentive to individual needs and queries. DRINKS 1. Pista Kesari Badam – Served in a kulhad, an ok drink, although the aroma clearly gave away the fact that the flavoring was artificial . 2. Ginger Spice Cooler – Did not like it personally, as the flavor of ginger was brought about using a concentrate, hence didn’t taste fresh. The others liked it though . FOOD This is what everything in a restaurant boils down to – The Grub on offer. Suffice to say, the experience was abysmal and left a lot to be desired STARTERS 1. Chitti Aayi Hai – The phrase is famous for a sad but patriotic Pankaj Udhas song. Sadness was my exact feeling after having this dish. The dish is basically spiced paneer, wrapped in a romaali roti and served with a Waldorf Salad (?) on top. For a Punjabi, paneer equals a melt in mouth feeling, but this was one stodgy and stale paneer, with an extremely sad and greasy exterior. The waldorf salad tasted basically of mayo and nothing else and added nothing to the dish. 2. Paneer Roller Coaster – A take on a classic bread roll. A spiced paneer, onion, coriander filling, encased within deep fried bread, served with a spicy mayo. The filling completely lacked taste and as in the case of the previous dish, the paneer was chewy. Bread rolls work only because the succulent filling complements the crunch well, this one was a disaster. Maybe I can take solace from the fact that the extremely oily rolls were probably good for my hands �?� 3. Cocktail Fries – Good fries = Crisp, well cooked on the inside, fried to perfection Bad Fries = Soggy, limp mess – Which is exactly what was served to us There was no pineapple in the mayo, though the apple chutney was interesting and good. 4. Khichiya Papad This one really drove me up the wall. I have such amazing memories of stunning Khichiya Masala papad, which used to be served outside Andheri (West) station. Was my regular evening snack and when I see this being messed up with, it just gets me mad. A good Khichiya has a nice crunch to it, and is thicker than the regular papad. The trick is to roast it well enough for it to crumble nicely, but this was an unmitigated disaster. Extremely thick and hard to break down, with a combination of toppings that didn’t really work because of the lack of seasoning. You just can’t expect to grate cheese on top like the street vendors do, and get away with things. What lies beneath the cheese is more important. MAINS 1. Baked Vada Pav – Small Pav stuffed with a potato masala, served with garlic powdered chutney and chips. The chips were the best part about this dish. The whole dish was way too dry and the stuffing lacked the flavor and punch that roadside eateries get. Maybe they could take lessons from Ashok (Kirti College) on how to get the crunch in a Vada Pav, rather than simply serve up some chips. 2. Chole Te Bhature – Chole Bhature is not just a dish for me, it’s a childhood memory. Having had numerous plates of this dish from every possible nook and corner of Delhi, I was fearing the worst when a colleague ordered this, given the experience with the starters. The fears were not unfounded. Rancid, absolutely rancid Chole served with chewy bhaturas, and this dish was a complete nightmare. I could not get past one morsel. The presentation though, did remind me that a cycle waalah serving Chole Bhature would definitely dish out better fare than this. 3. Manchurian Pizza – I and only I am to be blamed for even ordering this. Terrible, underdone and stodgy crust, with a topping that tastes worse than it looks in the click. 4. Dhabe ki Peshkash – Aloo Paratha served with Chole This was essentially a Aloo and anardana paratha, served with the now familiar & rancid chole, curd, pickle and that huge dollop of white butter than you see on top! Absolutely abysmal paratha, completely dry with a sub-par filling. If this is a paratha, all the Punjbai grandmoms would probably sue this place, and Amrik Sukhdev would shut shop looking at the horror of it all ! 5. Hum Saath Saath Hain – A decent dish finally, street type noodles with chilli paneer. The noodles were good, while the paneer, although not soft, had a reasonably good taste. Not something I’d strongly recommend though 6. Tawa Pulao with some sort of a papad, vegetables and cheese – Not sure of the menu name of this dish, but lacked the authentic taste of the tawa pulao, and there was too much of papad dominating the whole dish. The cheese never belonged there and in my opinion, took away the little that was going for the dish DESSERTS 1. Jalebi Bai – This was a much talked about, much instagrammed dessert. So a kesar mousse is sandwiched between a couple of jalebis, topped off with some dry fruits. The whole thing is frozen, presumably a batch made in the morning and kept in the chiller and then served as the orders arrive. Innovation is always good, but a sour Jalebi isn’t. Crispy is what a good jalebi is. A smooth mousse is good, a grainy one isn’t. A juicy, gooey from the inside, Jalebi is good, cold, crystalized sugar in your mouth isn’t. 2. Some Kulfi on a stick, with a chocolate twist – Was ok, nothing like a good creamy kulfi though. Just had a bite of this, as my taste buds had long left for the day. OVERALL VIEW Innovation in food has probably reached a level where things are done just for the sake of it, whether it adds anything to the dish or not. My experience at this outlet was a stark reminder of the same. You can play around with any cuisine, but the underlying rule is not to tamper with the ethos and the taste. Desiklub for me commits that cardinal sin and unless they learn from it, street vendors outside Maker Chambers at Nariman point aren’t going to lose any sleep.|positive
Rated Interesting! The minute you enter the place you cannot stop noticing the funky interiors. Each and everything is so perfectly placed that it creates a cool aura around. To match the interiors is the Bollywood music from 90's. You cannot get bored here. Coming to food, the fusion is a party for taste buds. You just cannot go wrong with pavbhaji noodles and desi version of chillas as tacos. Good flavours, decent quantity and a cool experience. This one surely gets a thumbs up.|positive
Rated Good place for some different taste of food, they do good manipulation in making meals....good interior....I liked the place, visited with my family, rates are bit high in comparison to the food...,|positive
Rated DesiKlub is part of the Out of The Box eateries in South Mumbai... Located in Maker Chambers V, Nariman Point. Their food is good not outstanding. A lot of effort is put in bringing you an experience of Street Food in a Restaurant..Full marks to them. Ordered Amerika Magherita & All Veggies Pizza, Size is Medium 8 inch priced at 225/- each.. Not much toppings to be true...! Masala Macaroni which is pasta in Makhanwala gravy with cheese, small portion but good taste.. Samosa Pav was yummy as well Lemon tea was chilled and zingy..! Chocolate Thali is a novelty for the Sweet tooth.. Their bill is served in a Traditional Iron..' Worth visiting with a group of friends, in order, to experiment with their dishes. They need to improve on quantity for sure as their service charge is a Whopping 10% to cover the Nariman Point rentals probably..!|positive
Rated Awesome place for the highest quality and most innovative snacks. Almost every snack served here is great. A high-quality, hygienic snack food alternative to unhygienic street food. Main meals are just okay, nothing great, more on the spicy side as the name goes.|positive
Rated The place is different and unique. The food is decent. Called for a lot of different things, all of these were good. The place has a lot of creativity, with the food as well as the ambience. It's a whole new concept of dining, from the food right to when you clear the Cheque, everything is different and fantastically done.|positive
Rated Innovative desserts, new twisty food, i found rolling pin to be one of an innovative cafe especially when it comes to dessert. Try out pavbhaji pizza and you can try out any desserts all are good.|positive
Rated You will go there for yummy VEG ONLY desserts especially chocolate ones and American fast food The chocolate marble waffle with Nutella was quite nice but honestly at almost the same price Haagen Dazs and Di Bella are better for waffles. Food: 4/5 Ambience: 4/5 Service: 3/5|positive
Rated Dessert Heaven in Mumbai!! It had been in my must-visit-soon places for quite some time. Tried the Dark Roast Ice coffee. It was a normal cold coffee in a fancy jar. Nothing about it was dark or roasty. The coffee was too watery. Not milky... Plain water cold coffee. Sad. But the Chocolate mousse stick was heavenly. It wasn't there on counter but the amicable manager had it made for us in 20mins. It was worth the wait. Costing wise it's bit on expensive side. Service is good.|positive
Rated Went to this place when me and my friend were quite hungry. We ordered the perfect double cheese burger, Grilled pepper crusted cottage cheese Sizzler and bullet nuggets. The burger order was goofed up and the server got me a mushroom burger instead. They changed it to the double cheese burger. The name of the burger and the taste are misleading. It doesn't come close to the perfect burgers that I've had. The sizzler was nice and filling. Though the service is good, they are not attentive and expressive while serving food. Later at the dessert counter I ordered for the mango cheese cake. It wasn't the best that I've had. The texture wasn't the best one. I like when the cheese starts melting into your mouth. I might visit this place again. But I am not asking for recommendations from the manager, I would rather trust reviews and feedback on social sites.|positive
Rated Well, the first thing that you notice after entering this place is its European styled interiors. The desserts display is very tempting and it makes sure you eat at least one. We had hazelnut mouse pastry and chocolate mouse candy. Both were class apart. Then we had cream cheese bagel which was average. Bagel was not fresh and was very hard and chewy. Cream cheese on the top of that was good. Moreover, fries accompanying bagel were too salty. Quinoa coffee mousse shake is what we ordered next. It was average in taste. So overall, a must try but only for desserts.|positive
Rated The Rolling Pin is a funky restaurant serving pure vegetarian Mediterranean and Italian cuisine and a range of funky desserts. Their collection of desserts brings the child out of me. They have got chocolate lollipops, chocolate sandals, chocolate lipstick, chocolate slabs, macarons, chocolate mousse on a stick and a very enormous collection of breads. I haven't tried their savoury items as yet and I'm looking forward to tasting them and posting a review soon enough. The service, exorcist for takeaways, is extremely slow given that had requested the staff weight hours in advance to keep and ice pack ready for my parcel dessert and still it took them well near half an hour when I had been there to collect it. Also, the cost awkward too low but there are huge taxes on it. It would do good if they could put up prices inclusive of taxes. Food: 4/5 Ambience: 4/5 Service: 3/5 Price: 3/5|positive
Rated I ordered a Ferro rocher chocolate cake and a Choco Ring Donut from the rolling pin through scootsy. The food items were delivered in an hour. The donut was not warmed up. It was ice cold so naturally I didnt like it. But I like the donut bun and the choco cream. The pastry was really heavens. The cream and cake was really good.|positive
Rated This place is a heaven for pastry n cake lovers.. U ll find all the flavors that suits ua taste buds.. Located in a very prime area. Its pretty easy to find it.. Sitting arrangements are good however pple prefer takeaway here.. Worth a visit|positive
Rated A sucker for Fries and Cheese like me? This is the place to be. Favorites? J in the Jungle and Sausage Fries. Savor it with a glass of ice tea and you're sorted. Three Steps to Cheese heaven: 1. Pick up your favourite Fries and a glass of Ice Team 2. Take a cab to Marine Drive 3. Sit there, Eat and Enjoy. For all you Fries-lovers, go visit this one for sure.|positive
Rated This place redefined the meaning of street fokd for me... Crazy creations and what a lively place. The best items on the menu are cheese chilli fries and red velvet shake or even snickers shake. They use different sauces like salsa mayo cheese etc and mix them in fries to just hit the right spots on your tastebuds. The music is always amazing.|positive
Rated The J is a tiny outlet in a building compound near HR college famous for its varities of fries. The place is a bit difficult to find but its worth finding. The fries out here are superb in taste. Loved the pizza fries .... yummy n cheesy.|positive
Rated I tried out their chilli cheese fries with extra chilli at the itsy bitsy food fest at lower parel... They were the best fries ever.... They make just the perfect combinations... And they provide a good variety to choose from... The quality and quantity both are great... All in all great value for money|positive
Rated All those gaga over potatoes would go insane trying out fries and wedges here. I am so much in love with this joint. The menu is every potato lover's dream come true. Oh my God! Just so yummy! 😵|positive
Rated Never been so fond of French fries.. Not a French fries lover.. But this place can't get over it.. Visited thrice within 15 days.. Like travelling from suburb to town just for the sake of French Fries.. But these assorted fries are worth drollin and mouth watering.. I simply have Pizza Fries and Chilli Cheese Fries.. God.. Its true tempting.. Must go place for all junk food lovers..|positive
Rated The best place i have ever been to. Heard alot about it frm my frnds n finnaly i went over here and tried some crazyyy food. The fries are just awesome there are soo mang varieties in it i soo i wish i had tasted everything. But yes i will some day. The shakes are also soo yummy especially the red velvet. The price is so cheap that we almost tasted many things. Price 5/5 Taste 5/5|positive
Rated Status is located in the town side of Mumbai and usually it is crowded so i would say to book a table or go after the peak hours. The infrastructure is well built, nice and comfortable. They use eucalyptus extracts as a room freshener which works well. For the food, I will say that it is the second best option to have food after the home cooked food for the people in that area. I went there with my colleagues during lunch hours and had Gujarati Thali there like everybody else. A thali served with 4 vegetables of palak paneer, coconut potato sabzi, malai meethi mutter and little gourd. Coconut potato was a surprise and others were good as well. A Gujarati dal is what everyone will savour. Being lucky, we were severed with Aam ras as a sweet dish although it was limited to just one serving. I also loved the sweet kadhi along with rice or khichdi and then goes the buttermilk in the end to beat the heat. Although a little expensive, it is for for the tongue as well as the tummy. Even the staff is well managed by the manager. So everything is worth it ! You should consider having lunch here if you happen to be in this area.|positive
Rated All time favourite dining. One of the best place which is more of family - kind of dining. Serves only vegetarian food which is delicious. One should really try mini pav bhaji, onion rings and cheese corn toast. Service is lightning. Food - 8.5/10 Service - 8/10 Ambience - 6/10 Pricing - 7/10|positive
Rated Most crowded on weekends as its one of the famous place for vegetarians to hog. The food here is a bit sweet which is something i dont favour. The ambience is fine. The staff is too arrogant I wouldn't recommend this place.|positive
Rated Extremely overcrowded on weekends obviously because of the Status it holds among vegetarians.. After a waiting time of around 45 minutes we finally got a table.. Ordered a Gujarati thali and the food was excellent.. Must say not all the dishes lived up to the expectations but majority of them were delicious. Must try their desserts like aam ka ras and gulab jamun.. All in all a nice place...|positive
Rated A most go to for every vegetarian I love the hara bhara kebab This is the fastest serving restaurant The food is always fresh The lassi is worth trying out!|positive
Rated Food is Ok.. When u order full thali u also expecting Good personalise service..this place is somewhat tired for servicing.They also find difficult to distinguish different between Jain and Normal Food.taste is Just ok ..Gujarati People don't eat such sweet food as they are preparing ..Ala Cart order is far better choice to order here than Thali.. Masala Chas along with thali and khandvi and khichadi is very Good..|positive
Rated This is a vintage place for all foodies, one could say it is one of the oldest fine dining places in Mumbai. Divided in two parts, one serves quick south Indian / fast food and the other part serves authentic Mumbai version of punjabi food. In the fast food section, the Reshmi paratha with kurma and Mysore Sada Dosa are lip smacking, and there is no item on the menu you can go wrong with, take your own pick as per your preference. Coming to the Punjabi section, Corn On Toast, Paneer Tikka, Hara bhara kabab, Capsicum Rings, Tomato Soup, Corn Soup are renowned starters / soups. Paneer Lazeez is their chef special and must have main course vegetable. They have now started serving desserts as well from Spesso which is their premium fine dining arm. That pretty much makes this restaurant complete in all senses.|positive
